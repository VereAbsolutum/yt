       "[\"inside the demon realm where a giant castle sits the warrior vermouth and His Four comrades Venture into the castle to subdue the demon Kings they had previously slain three of the five demon Kings but only two remained a horde of demons swarmed them and vermouth with just one slash of his sword clears the way instantly this is the power of the great vermouth a mage walks behind him and says that against this many she can most definitely use her powers she does so and countless elements pop out of nowhere clearing the way this is seya the wise a priestess attempts to bless everyone with her holy magic and that 's when a demon attacks her but it seems that she 's not that defenseless Anis the faithful the burliest of the group attacks with a giant Axe and with just one swing he butchers most demons in his path and a reain of blood and body parts wash over him [ __ ] the Brave the last person in the group bearing quite a lot of scars demands vermouth stop going ahead and makes his way through the demons this is camel the foolish he was always jealous of vermouth and he considered him his rival but nobody really recognized that having cleared all of the fodder the party looks around for potential Clues that 's when Hamill spots that vermouth is in danger and at the last second jumps in front of him taking the attack fully the one who attacked seems to be a powerful demon and Hamill falls down as this attack has proved fatal the demon attacks vermouth in the same way but now prepared he Dodges and with one swift moot Cuts him in half the party rushes to Hamill 's side and vermouth looks down noting that he did n't need to die like that haml says that this death is Honorable and until this very moment which would become his last he regretted his past as he was n't honest with his friends Hamill reaches his hand forward and demands vermouth defeat the demon king he grabs his hand and swears in his Warrior 's name that all of the demon Kings shall be massacred haml Smiles with a certain regret and makes his peace with everyone he asks a niece to pray for him he says to [ __ ] that he 's the bravest warrior there is and when he turns to seya he notes that he always liked her that 's when we find out this was just a story a boy with gray hair and yellow eyes read who says that he never said he liked seya this is just pure fiction every time he reads this nonsensical book it gets him extremely angry which person wrote this like a children 's book if only the author were n't Anonymous he would be able to show him a thing or two he picks the book back up and wonders why everyone has such great titles like the wise or the great yet he was the foolish was this perhaps written by some guy he pummeled 300 years ago the same goes for his companions as well why did n't they do anything to this book but it 's fair considering that they would never think the once- dead Hamill would reincarnate like this with all his memories intact he Hamill died in the middle of subjugating the demon Kings 300 years ago and was reincarnated as a descendant of of vermouth now he goes by Eugene lionhart and he 's 13 years old while he was still alive vermouth had many concubines aside from his first wife Eugene finds this strange as he was n't the type to chase women needlessly did he perhaps change his mind but it would n't be so bad as everyone has needs so he gets it the only families considered direct descendants are the children of the first wife even with the same surname which is lionart Eugene 's family is cons considered an indirect Branch these types of families are forbidden from training their mana and from using real swords before the blood sacrifice ritual for a 13-year-old he 's quite buff and he thinks that today is the last time he uses a wooden sword he trains with his sword and his movements are extremely fast not long after beginning to train he snaps the dummy into two his father looks at this with a scared expression and notes that this is not the first time he has broken one of these Eugene turns to him and his father notices how muscular he is quite scary for a 13-year-old Eugen may be his son but sometimes he 's scared of him as he does n't act or speak like a child there is no innocence left in those eyes of his and even though he lost his mother at a very young age he has not once missed her Eugene says that the blacksmith in this town is utter trash and selling lowquality garbage like this should be considered a crime and punished accordingly his father coughs and says that he will give him a warning but on the note of stuff to do the blood ritual is tomorrow Eugene thinks that this Blood ritual of theirs is a dumb Lion Heart tradition held once every 10 years every child between 10 and 15 whether from the direct Branch or otherwise gathers at the main Family Residence for the ritual there they compete in a sort of trial to find out who is really worthy of the lionart surname but the main branches have an advantage as they they are allowed to train with real weapons and Mana from a young age so they are basically making sure the main family does better and that the branch family stay at their level the father looks at the dummy and thinks that this son of his has such talent that He can not imagine him being his son and if only he were born into the main family but no if only he were n't this talented just like him he would n't have to see and feel the difference between reality and his talents Eugene asks what happened for him to have such a sad expression but his father dismisses it as nothing Eugene sze and thinks that he 's probably beating himself up for not being a good father the father suddenly grabs him by the shoulders and demands he never compete with the children from the main family as however talented he really is he wo n't match the power of those kids who have learned with swords and Mana for a long time Eugene smiles and says that he wo n't but this is a lie as this is just an easy win considering he 's basically fighting some 10-year-olds he spots another dummy and while walking to it thinks that in this Blood ritual there will be three from the main family and six from the branch family one of the three children from the main family is the son of the first wife and the other two are twins from a concubine so aside from the two high Authority Branch families the rest can be considered losers Eugene raises his sword in the air and destroys yet another dummy in a single blow now he really wants to see how good the descendants of vermouth really are tomorrow arrives and while Eugene takes the carriage to the ritual he thinks that when he was a haml in his past life he thought of himself as a genius things were easy to learn for him even as a child and his Improvement was fast compared to others but this did n't stop vermouth from commending his technique noting that if he tried harder he would be much much stronger he says that he 's doing his utmost and not everyone is a genius like he is the only real problem he has had was that he was n't a genius but someone close to him was skilled with swords and Magic he bore the nicknames the God of War and the master of all vermouth is great he was formerly just a mere Duke in his homeland the KE Empire but retired from his position and was praised as a warrior until the end and the other Companions of his seya the wise who took the position of magic Tower Master is the youngest master of all time in the Mage Kingdom of aroth anise the faithful who was extremely rotten inside is now called a saintess in the Holy Empire of Urus and there 's even scripture about her teachings [ __ ] the brave surprisingly managed to make his own kingdom which he sadly named after himself so naturally one\",\n",
       " \"is forced to think they had pretty good lives until they died so why is the Demon King still breathing back then vermouth definitely swore that he would destroy all of the demon Kings the Shameless bastards he originally died at the demon king of incarcerations C castle and vermouth seems to have made a promise to that demon king after his death because of that certain promise the war with the demon kings came to an end and the world was at peace which persists to this day 300 years later a man who 's also inside the carriage with him Lord Gordon notes that he must be quite nervous but if he is he will struggle when he actually meets the main family Eugene thankss him for the advice and Gordon says that from here on it 's all lionhart property but he does n't need to prepare to get off as the main residence is still quite far away Eugene wonders why he 's so smug considering that this is not even his property he says that it must be inconvenient if it 's this large and Gordon notes that there are several warp gates scattered about so it 's actually pretty okay Eugene wants to ask why he was n't allowed to use one of those but he can already predict the answer and would rather just shut up and smile after a while they arrive at the main Family Residence which is quite big with shiny gold all around but Eugene is prepared they walk towards the main building and Eugene is n't even surprised that he did n't get a welcome ceremony vermouths Lion Heart the only people allowed to have the lion Crest on their left chest are those from the direct bloodline he asked Gordon if any of his relatives have arrived and he notes that he 's the first so they should move to the guest house a maid by the name of nah greets him and says that she will be attending to his every need during his stay if there was ever anything he wanted all he needed to do was ring this Bell Eugene is thankful they at least gave him a personal maid and he asks about her age she says that she 's 16 and that she 's only just finished her training period Eugene smirks and thinks that whoever assigned this inexperienced ma to him must be trying to start a problem if he were to lecture the inexperienced made for a mistake but it does n't matter who thought of the idea as they are boldly trying to harass him he asks when the others will arrive and she says that they should be here within the next 4 days at the late latest he gets up and asks her to guide him to the training grounds nah is kind of surprised but she still does so outside of the main building two main family children talk about Eugene and how he 's from a small country town and probably trains with rakes instead of Swords the boy says that his Carriage must stink because of how he lives and even if he 's a relative he still would have to pay for damaging the main Family Residence right the girl says that he 's absolutely correct so they must go and scold him the boy says that they are just giving him a warning and demands that the girl seal follow him another main family kid looks out of the window at them but that 's when seal notices and glares at him with the eyes of a beast causing him to back away Eugene begins training with a spear and while doing so notes that he was in no way lazy in his past life as haml when it came to training but this new body has been furiously trained since he reincarnated and no matter how much he pushes his body he has n't gotten sick once and his injuries heal extremely quickly this body of vermouths descendant is capable of stuff he would only dream of nah looks at him training and is mesmerized to think he would be capable of moving this fast with sandbags on his arms and spear that 's when she hears someone ask what this guy is doing and she recognizes these as the siblings cayenne and seal also asking what they are doing here Cayenne repeats his question what is that guy doing there Eugene stops his training and says that it 's very clear what he 's doing practicing the spear he also calls him an idiot and seal pushes her brother to do something as that country kid just called him a main family member an idiot Cayenne gets angry and demands an apology Eugene instantly apologizes leaving him quite silent he says that it was n't sincere at all he needs to bow down with sincerity then apologize Eugene says that they must be the same age AG so why should he bow down if they are friends Kenne asks who would dare consider them friends and even if they are both lion Hearts they are not equals seal reminds him about the carriage and kayenne begins berating him and demands he clean the carriage he came with as it probably stinks from all the farm animals he must have taken care of Eugene just looks at this excuse of an insult and asks Nah if she 's his personal servant she confirms this and says that she should clean the carriage instead of him nah does n't know what to do do and cenne notes that he told him to clean it specifically so how dare he order a servant to do it is he really disrespecting the order of cayenne lionhart Eugene introduces himself and seal does so as well Cayenne says that there 's no point in being nice to trash like him and since he ignored a direct order he has Dishonored him so a duel must take place Eugene smirks and says that he should not throw that word around so easily as it Bears a heavy burden he just wants to continue training so why ca n't they leave Ken asks if he 's scared and that 's when his expression changes he really must be scared right so in that case he should bow his head and apologize for what he 's done Eugene says that he 's in no way scared and also does n't want to duel or apologize kayenne says that he does n't want to do anything so is he just going to run away his parents probably did n't teach him what honor truly is that 's when Eugene begins dropping his arm weights and Ken asks what he 's doing Eugene notes that he wanted a duel and that 's what he will get so he should throw the damn handkerchief already Eugene continues to strip and it seems that even the vest he was wearing was also heavy cenne can only look at how many weights this guy had thinking that they were only for show up until now but now he ca n't back down as he 's the one who challenged him to a duel so seal will make fun of him for the rest of Eternity if he were to back down and he also must punish him for tainting his his honor he throws the handkerchief in his Direction and demands that the duel commence Eugene finally takes off the final weight and when the handkerchief falls to his face he accepts in that very second Eugene strikes cion instantly in the gut ending the fight in just one blow seal rushes to the side of her brother but backs away when she sees how much he 's vomiting she turns her attention to Eugene and says that he 's a coward and that was in no way an honorable duel Eugene says that there was no cowardice there as the duel started when the handkerchief was thrown so it 's his fault for letting his guard down seil ca n't deny this and instead says that he must have trained in Mana right Eugene notes that the branch lines are n't allowed to train with Mana until after the success ritual seal does n't believe it and calls him a liar as there is no way he 's able to swing something so heavy without mana and also the attack that he performed was too fast to the point where even if Kenne were to be on full guard he could n't have been able to do anything Eugene smirks and says that his eyes are n't just for show after all she notes that his mouth is quite foul and he says that he has already heard that one plenty but\",\n",
       " \"it 's also not like her brother got beaten without putting up a fight as when his attack reached him he instinctively dodged backwards to reduce the damage that 's nothing short of amazing given that he does n't have any real experience just yet Eugene notes that this guy has potential but is not strong enough to be considered a descendant of vermouth Cayenne gets up and with heavy breath calls Eugene a coward who says that they really are siblings considering they say the exact same things he makes his way towards him and notes that if he 's an HonorBound descendant of the lionhart family he should humbly admit defeat after losing Cayenne becomes embarrassed and Eugene thinks that he should have held back a little as this is the child of a patriarch wo n't they do something to punish him that 's when a man rushes to see what 's going on with a Stern face Eugene notices the lack of a lion on his chest so he 's probably just a knight hired by the family and pretty skilled at that kayenne calls him by his name hezar and rushes to his side noting that he lost to a country person like that guy he challenged him to a fair duel and lost hazar looks at Eugene and introduces himself as the one in charge of instructing Cayenne Eugene also introduces himself and says that he 's from gdal hazar notes that is where Jar 's family is and Eugene confirms that man is his father hazar demands to know what happened here and Eugene says that Kenne simply picked a fight with him and also insulted his father Kenne denies this but Eugene says that he told him that he was not taught Honor by his father and also called him a coward all of these insults to him and also to his father were n't they enough reasons to accept the duel hazar thinks that all of these are valid reasons and takes Cayenne away noting that they should get his injuries treated as soon as possible while leaving seal waves him goodbye and he does the same a few days pass and while having a very big meal n offers him the information that he requested Deon Hansen and Jules are planned to arrive tomorrow at noon while gargas and desyra are planning on coming that evening through a warp gate Eugene thinks that they 're coming faster than expected and the success ritual will commence soon he walks out of the dining hall and apologizes to Vermouth as he 's going to be messing with his descendants from now on so he hopes he wo n't be upset about it but it 's not like he wanted to become one of his descendants it 's just a damn reincarnation after all Cayenne gets interrogated by his mother the second wife of the main family anaila and asks if her son really lost against someone from a branch family hazar confirms it and she demands Kean come next to her she strikes him with the fan in the same place he got hit and asks if he really lost in a single strike Cayenne says that she 's hurting him and she demands that he stopped complaining as well as an answer from hezar did that kid really not train with Mana he confirms this and says that Eugene does n't possess an ounce of Mana in his body she asks seal how her brother lost and she explains that just as the duel started Eugene hit him with the spear and cayenne tried to retreat but it was too late the mother laments The Duel being lost in a single blow and cenne tries to tell her something but that 's when she slaps him with all of her might and screams demanding to know how he lost a duel in front of those lowly beasts and to a child that lacks Mana soon his father will be back for the ritual so how 's she going to face him then huh Cayenne begins shaking and apologizes the mother says that she would like nothing more than to cut hezar head off but her husband favors him he must train Cayenne once more so that he may never disgrace her like this again with with that they leave and hazar seems to be more of a parent to Cayenne than his mother ever will be she eventually calms down and asks seal to befriend Eugene or whatever his name was seal asks why and her mother explains that right now he 's strong enough to win against her brother so that 's why she thinks that if it were her way she would kill that little cheat but then she would become the first suspect and if a feud were ever to break out within the family the Guardians of the familial law would come and she must avoid that at all costs the mother says that she just needs to become friends with him and seal says that she will do it as she also has an interest in him so she will befriend him her mother Smiles an evil expression running across her face the next day three boys from the branch families arrived at the Family Residence Hansen donon and jwes while Eugene is training nah comes up to him with his clothes and notes that everyone has arrived Eugene says that he thought they would have come at night but they are here earlier than expected nah notes that the patriarch has also arrived and he must quickly go but he also needs to change his clothes Eugene notes that he would be late if he were to do that so he will just go meet him like this they all wait at the front gate for the patriarch and Eugene looks around he spots the second wife an ailla and the person in front of her is the first wife theonis and that depressed looking guy is the main family 's eldest son and first in line for Success IOD lionhart the patriarch finally arrives Gillard lionhart along with the younger brother Keon Gillard immediately goes to iode and asks if his skills have improved iode tries to avoid eye contact and says that he 's trying his best as usual this does n't please Gillard and he moves on to cayenne and seal noting how much they have grown since he was gone he also congratulates one of his brothers Guilford for having a son and apologizes for not being there to see such a BL blessing Guilford says that there 's no need for such things and Gillard moves his attention to the children of the branch families he notes that they should have a meal together and there they will discuss the blood succession ritual they sit at the dining table and Eugene spots the other two people who arrived gargas and desyra he thinks that these were the people who came through the warp with the patriarch to attend the ritual so are they perhaps of higher prestige in the lionart branch families he also noticed is a man who is clearly not a lion heart and thinks that only the patriarch and the ritual attendees are supposed to come to this meal seal also looks at him curiously and asks her father who that person is he says that he was planning on introducing him at a later date but they should do it now the person gets up and introduces himself as Ian from the red magic Tower in aroth everyone is surprised and IOD notes that he 's the master of the magic Tower causing Eugene to spit out his drink they all look at him and raran asks if he 's fine to which he replies yes Eugene thinks that if he 's the red magic Tower Master he 's senya 's direct disciple or rather the disciple of senya 's disciples disciple 300 years ago seya attained the position of green magic Tower Master at the youngest age in aro 's history not only had she improved all the spell books in aroth but she had also helped countless Disciples of other magic towers and even provided advice to the other Tower Masters to this very day the green magic Tower master and roarian still consider her their Great Master but the most surprising thing is that he would meet someone related to his old companion so early Gillard begins talking to Eugene and notes that he heard about him from theonas and that his son Dishonored him and his parents Cen looks down in shame and Eugene says that he did but holds no real grudge against him Gillard asks if it 's because he won the duel and Eugene notes that it would have\",\n",
       " \"been if he were to lose because if he were unable to protect his honor then it is his duty to at least accept this as fact Gillard smiles and notes that he 's better than his son he starts speaking with cayenne and notes that he 's not ashamed of his defeat but it does shame him that he 's embarrassed by losing and how much he worries about how he 's going to feel about it it was a duel that started because of his insults in the first place but he still has n't apologized even after losing Kenne tries to say something but Gillard interrupts him and says that he is a Lion Heart first and for formost and that the great vermouth is his ancestor if he really is someone from his bloodline he should act like it and respect not only his own honor but also the honor of others Cayenne looks at him and with a blush on his face apologizes Eugene notices how much he 's forcing himself right now but it does n't really matter Gillard says that his father must be jard and he apologizes as he does n't know him directly Eugene says that it 's only natural that he does n't as his family lives in a very rural area for someone like him to know about them Gillard asks if his father taught him those moves and he instructed him on the basics but after that he trained on his own desire is surprised he trained by himself and gargas is even more surprised that he managed to beat cenne Now gilard notes that this succession ritual will be an interesting one this time and the food comes after it is plated and served Gard says that the food might not be up to their expectations but they must be hungry so they should start eating after the meal gilard notes that the reason he decided to hold this meal was because he wanted to share some details about the upcoming ritual they all eagerly wait for him to talk and he says that although he 's the patriarch and it 's quite embarrassing to admit it the blood succession ritual is just too discriminatory naturally it is a tradition of the main Family and Children of Branch families are not allowed to train with real weapons or Mana until after the ritual is over if the ritual occurred under these Fair conditions there would be no way a child from a branch family would beat a child from the main family in this case three of his children will be entering however he believes that it 's fair that he not only check on his own children but also the potential of all the children who hold the Lion Heart name the ritual exists to prove to oneself that one is a descendant of the great vermouth so it does n't matter if that person is from the main family or otherwise Eugene smirks and notes that this descendant is much Kinder than vermouth himself Gillard notes that because of all of this he asked for help with this ritual and that 's why roarian is here he gets up and with a flick of his fingers the table transforms into a map of a labyrinth he says that the ritual will take place in here and everyone will enter from a different entrace and all they have to do is defeat the boss monster in the middle of said Labyrinth they will also have to avoid traps and defeat any monsters they come across naturally everything that occurs inside of it is just as an illusion made with magic so it 's basically just a big Mind Trick but they should n't falter as it will feel just like reality Eugene thinks that he 's not only summoning magic but also using Advanced illusionary magic no wonder he 's earned the position of tower Master reran continues and says that if one of them manages to defeat the boss monster the ritual will come to a close and everyone will be assigned a point value based on how well they did one of them asks if it 's fine if they are unable to escape the Labyrinth and he confirms this and if they are too scared they can just stay at the entrance of the labyrinth Eugene asks what they get for defeating the Labyrinth boss and Gallard smirks he will allow them to take anything they want from the main family 's underground treasury Eugene is excited now and finds this amazing while walking away he thinks that it still should be easy and his only real problem is what to choose from the main family treasury that 's when he spots desyra and gargas who seemed to have been waiting for him gargas asks if he really won against cenne and Eugene confirms this and also if they are done questioning him on useless stuff he will be leaving gargas tries to stop him but he just shrugs not knowing what to say Eugene makes his way to the training grounds and continues to practice but he gets interrupted by desyra and gargas who are waiting for him to finish with desyra holding Spears in each of her hands you Jean wonders why they have n't just gone to sleep yet and that 's when gargas walks in front and after a short second rips out his shirt he begins Breathing heavily and pumps all of his muscles making them glisten Eugene wonders what just happened and gargas notes that he can touch it but Eugene rejects this instantly gargas notes that his family has a secret muscle growth potion that accelerates muscle growth depending on training while not accumulating Mana within the body and naturally there are n't many side effects to this is he perhaps interested Eugene asks if he 's here to sell him the potion and desyra says that there is one major side effect if he were to consume it he would start growing a beard regardless of gender she notes that she heard that he used a spear in his battle with cayenne so why is he using a sword now Eugene notes that he uses both swords and Spears making desyra think that he 's just saying that he 's good with most weapons she throws him a spear which he catches and she says that her specialty is the spear so they should fight Eugene thinks that it would be easier to deal with her than that potion salesman and he 's also quite interested in how strong the high-ranking kids of the branch families really are so he accepts The Duel they get into position and Eugene asks what gargas is still doing here he notes that he 's the referee as even though this is just a simple Spar it still must be fair Eugene thinks that he 's acting the same way as [ __ ] is he not secretly a descent descendant of that Meathead he notes that they will begin when he says start and desyra urges him to do it already she thinks about Eugene and notes that his ability to use both swords and Spears must be a bad joke she will be the one to show him that the spear ca n't be mastered that easily gargas gives them the go-ahead and she rushes in thinking that the one who strikes first wins but she suddenly stops as Eugene is emanating A Dangerous Aura and it 's clear that he has no openings he asks why she stops so suddenly and this ticks her off making her charge in once again she strikes but Eugene counters her attack they continue to do this and he thinks that considering the lack of Mana in her body she 's actually pretty good and she 's still quite young so the possibilities are infinite but in her current state she 's no match for the likes of him he continues to block and notes that she did n't hit him even once she demands he shut up and thinks that if he thinks that he can block all of her attacks without dodging it will cost him dearly she charges in again and they continue trading blows until she dashes behind him and prepares a mighty strike thinking that he will not be able to block this one Eugene raises his foot and catches the spear with it making desyra desperately try to reclaim it but it 's already over and this duel has already ended Eugene lionhardt has won later that night gargas wakes Eugene up by noting that they should work together Eugene wonders where he lives to wake a person up like that and gargas says that he just wanted to hear his response Eugene notes\",\n",
       " \"that he heard the details of the ritual earlier right they are all coming from different entrances so how are they supposed to do that in the first place gargas notes that they will end up at the same place the center of the labyrinth where the boss monster sits the twins from the main family will also most likely work together Eugene asks if what he 's suggesting is that they defeat the boss monster together and he confirms this Eugene says that he can probably do it by himself anyway and desyra who was leaning against the wall all of this time says that he 's just full of himself and foolish but still she ca n't deny his strength and if he were to help them they would surely defeat the boss monster with no real difficulty he asks why they are so desperate to defeat that thing and she says that in this ritual where both Maine and Branch families participate someone from a branch family has n't even once however they have that possibility now as they can work together does n't he want to show defeat to the main family at least once anaila looks out of the window and thinks that roarian who also came here to help with the ritual is most likely scouting iote as his disciple since he was young he always liked reading more than being active and because of this he has shown aptitude for the magic Arts if IOD were to become rian 's disciple he would have to leave the family residence in that time Kenne and seal will grow up a lot so iode will basically give up on being the successor the only real problem she has right now is with the richual ual as her children will forever be called the children of a concubine they were only able to establish their position because she did n't let this bring them down but to think her son would lose to a child from a mere Branch family she would rather have Eugene clear the Labyrinth the fastest as if he were strong enough to do this the main family would be put to shame and Ken 's defeat would be covered up 4 days later the succession ritual is about to commence and everyone is gathered up Roberton prepares some magic and gives each of them a blue orb he notes that first they will create their weapons so everyone should try to mold the light into the weapon they want they all begin doing so with seal being the first to succeed and creating a Rapier she begins testing it out and asks what would happen if it were to break roberanes and says that both the sword and Labyrinth are created with magic so the sword she has right now ca n't break in The Labyrinth she asks if she can make something like an animal instead of a sword and rers notes that she could make a doll or Golem but never a living being iode asks why they ca n't and he notes that it 's considered taboo magic giving birth to another life is something beautiful and it is a power that only living beings have IOD is quite surprised at his response and gargas succeeds in creating his weapon a giant great sword he notes that it 's like the great sword he uses back at home but more real and less waden desyra wonders who asked and finally manages to make make her weapon a spear everyone also finishes creating theirs with most being swords Eugene however also creates a shield and that 's when seal asks what he will do if they meet in The Labyrinth will she perhaps fight her Eugene asks the patriarch if fighting is allowed and he confirms this as it was part of the ritual in the first place however good judgment and cooperation are also very important as they are a family that all bear the same name Seal thinks of the world 's family and begin smiling at Eugene who is extremely creeped out by this with this done Roberton also gives them some necklaces and notes that they are connected to their minds if they were to become distressed in The Labyrinth the necklace will react and when that happens he will consider it a dangerous situation and will intervene Eugene notes that it 's just a safety tool to prevent accidents robertin also says that if they ever want to get out they can just tap on the necklace and ask for help with that everything is prepared and they can now enter the Labyrinth they will enter from the same entrance but will be split up the moment they walk inside they all head towards the gate and seal wishes Eugene good luck who reluctantly does the same he walks through and finds himself in a corridor he thinks that he went through something like this in his past life and that the ceiling is blocked off he takes a swing of his sword and notes that this space is pretty tight so it will be difficult to use a weapon with a Long Reach and that 's prec precisely why he chose a sword and shield as this basic combination ca n't be beat in most situations he doubts that this challenge will be of any difficulty however as it was just made for kids with that he takes his first step into the Labyrinth a few small slimes attack a participant and he begins flailing the sword around with no Rhyme or Reason after he gets stuck to the ground he desperately asks for help and reran appears teleporting both of them out of the dungeon an hour after the succession ritual began three had already failed Gillard looks at them with a certain disappointment in his eyes and notes that they should go rest he sits down with reran and they watch how everyone is doing specifically gargas who swings his giant great swword around and it often gets stuck but because of his great strength he pushes through and still manages to do heavy damage Gillard notes that his movements are a tad awkward but he 's managing just fine as he 's not having any difficulty with the monsters he 's facing he looks at desyra who begins fighting some slimes and when she finally strikes one he notes that bladed weapons do n't do much against slimes so she needs to find an opportunity and Escape Gillard thinks that she 's quick and intuitive also prioritizing getting out of the labyrinth more than facing monsters he looks at Cayenne who spots some traps and thinks that his mother already got him and seal some maps for several labyrinths before the ritual took place so they studied them and also the types of traps that were most likely to be put in place he picks up a pebble and throws it in front causing a lot of arrows to come out of the wall Gillard notes that he 's careful but uses this to evade traps which is not bad at all he looks at seal who is now fighting a goblin the goblin attacks but she Dodges swiftly and Strikes when she has the chance she begins making her way to the middle again but finds herself at a dead end and notes that she will just go back to the forked path from earlier Gillard notes that she 's flexible and sensible with her thinking but she 's just as childish he moves on to iode who is confronted by a goblin but instead of being scared he 's amazed at what magic can do the goblin finally attacks and after a few blocks he manages to cut him still amazed at what magic can really become Roberton looks closer and notes that iode seems quite interested in Magic Gillard says that he 's loved magic ever since he was a child and he used to be taught by a mage from the capital they invited but he has n't really tried to learn much since then Roberti asks why that is and Gillard know notes that he gave up because of this harsh reality as he has decided to become the patriarch because of his mother 's wishes and Magic proves to be no Advantage when competing for Success robertin notes that magic is a difficult journey in spite of its countless possibilities and Gillard says that he wishes he would actually take that Journey if he still has a passion for the magic Arts he wo n't be able to refuse a position as the disciple of the red magic Tower Master Rober itan says that he ca n't give him a straight answer just yet but he will take him along because he knows him\",\n",
       " \"however if he 's not fit to be his disciple he ca n't take him Gallard agrees as he had no intention to force that upon him and just wanted to bet on iod 's dreams that and iot respects seya the wise more than vermouth his own ancestor robertia notes that he was the same as he much preferred Sea 's stories to vermouths Adventures senya always came up with amazing Solutions when her comrades were in danger Gillard knows that he also read that story when he was a child and truthfully neither vermouth nor seya were his favorites Rober itan asks who it is but before Gillard could answer his attention was grabbed by what Eugene was doing fighting a gigantic troll the troll tries to bash Eugene into the ground but he blocks with his shield allowing him to strike at multiple points they both look at this display with surprise and Gillard finds it nothing short of amazing he takes down the troll and Gillard notes that this is Eugene lionart the troll explodes into golden bits and Gillard notes that he 's quite amazing for a 13-year-old who he doubts has fought a real troll before he was n't even scared and he was also able to take the troll down cleanly and confidently robaron notes that the trolls were n't put in place for the kids to fight but more like traps they had to avoid so he 's just as surprised Gillard notes that he 's still young but is n't his talent just exceptional reran says that he already knows that they call these kinds of kids geniuses is gargas also begins fighting a troll but finds beaten up and most likely on his last legs but he summons the strength to charge in and with a Swift Dodge manages to cut the trolls giving him the opportunity to end the fight after he breathes heavily and Roars like a beast before the troll disappears and he falls down he thinks that he ca n't believe it managed to pierce through the muscles he 's so proud of and break his ribs trolls are truly strong he also got hit by all sorts of traps before he fought the Troll And since he 's been hurt this much he doubts the other kids are less injured than him without any strength remaining he falls down Cayenne also finds himself near a troll and thinks that this is in no way a monster they are supposed to take down he distracts it with a rock and finds the opportunity to run away before it can notice anything that 's when seal finds him and says that they started at entirely different points but still manag to meet Cen says that it just shows how closer to the center they are but this is great as now she can follow him and wo n't lose her way she agrees and kayenne thinks that since he was humiliated in front of his sister by that bastard he must take this chance to recover his damaged reputation seal notes that since this is a dungeon any type of monster can appear right Cayenne says that she 's correct but why ask something like this seal asks If ghosts are included and cayenne freezes up a bit with a trembling voice he asks if she 's afraid of ghosts and if she is she should n't worry as he will protect her that 's when he turns the corner and desyra appears with a lot of blood on her he begins screaming uncontrollably and she does the same while seal just watches kayen notices Desy and demands to know why she scared him she says that he was the one to scare her with his screaming and he asks why she has so much blood on her she notes that it 's from a trap and thinks that the Ambush was a failure so she needs to retreat seal knows that she 's running away and cayen thinks that he 's shown his unsightly side to seal again so naturally he ca n't forgive desyra he screams that they should go after her and they do so making desyra think that she wo n't be able to win a 2V1 and also wondering where gargas is he has passed out cold suddenly a trap activates from under her but she finds her footing and manages to make it to the other side she continues running and cayenne wonders if they need to take another road because of this hole but but he ca n't let himself be humiliated in front of Cel any further he was going to save his Mana for the boss but now that there 's no other choice he will have to use it he does so and barely manages to get across he offers seal his hand and notes that he will catch her but she can also use mana and she makes her way over just fine they continued chasing desyra and they did so until the three of them reached the center of the labyrinth where the boss stands Eugene asks why the three of them came together and Cen asks what is doing here Eugene notes that he was just waiting curious to see who would manage to get here first Ken asks if he was really waiting for everyone to get here and seal notes that he 's the first one who got here he confirms this and desyra says that if he got to the center and managed to wait she 's presuming that he reconsidered the offer she and gargas made and wants to defeat the boss together right Eugene knows that they talked about something like that but he waited to offer all of them a chance at the boss first he would be able to deal with that thing in no time but it would be unfair if they made the effort of reaching the Labyrinth and arrived at nothing right Kenne is angry at this mockery and Eugene notes that this Beast does n't attack if they are not in its range so it 's basically just waiting for them what he 's suggesting is that they all fight it in order of who arrived after himself first would be desyra then cenne and after that seal sounds fair right desyra asks if he really wants them to fight that gantic thing alone and Eugene says that she also got hurt so if she thinks winning is n't an option she can just give up desyra says that she will do it and bandages herself with a handkerchief while she walks towards it cayen asks why he has n't fought the boss yet Eugene says that he will after everyone else is done with it Kenne notes that he might not get the chance as he will surely defeat the boss by himself Eugene smiles and says that if he really manages to do that he will give him the utmost respect respect for the rest of his life this makes Cayenne excited and demands he not forget the promise he just made he sits down and thinks that the Minotaur is a common monster in the labyrinths but it 's way bigger than he imagined and is surely bigger than the troll he met however that 's the only scary thing about it as it does n't seem hostile compared to a troll or ogre with this he should be able to defeat it in one Fell Swoop the minotaur 's eyes open and it slowly gets up daa looks at it and wonders how she can kill something that huge however she has come too far to give up now she charges in and the Minotaur immediately tries to squish her she Dodges and swiftly gets back on her feet allowing an attack on its hand but the spear is n't going in and she thinks that its hide is way too hard to pierce that 's when the Minotaur grabs her hole and desyra thinks that surely this is the end of her life but it simply throws her back at the group and seal asks why it did that when it could have just killed her outright Eugene notes that it 's not a real monster and the battle was already over when she was grabbed so it let her go cenne gets up as it 's his turn now and notes that he will show him the difference between a branch family and the prestigious main family Eugene just smirks and cenne hates his arrogance does he really think he ca n't handle a single oversized cow he activates his mana and notes that everyone should be watching him he coats his weapon in mana and desyra thinks that this must be sword or which can cut\",\n",
       " \"through anything but in order to even manifest the sword Aura a decade of Mana training would be required she ca n't believe how far ahead the main family is compared to them Eugene also finds it impressive that he can use that at such a ripe age and Ken thinks that he ca n't maintain the aura for long but it should be plenty to kill the thing in front of him that 's when the aura dissipates and in a panic he whales the sword around trying to make it come back Eugene thinks of gillard 's words about how this ritual purpose is to check the potential of those who hold the blood of vermouth and that it does n't matter if they are from a branch or the main family Eugene notes that this Labyrinth was created by Roberton and it appears that he made it in such a way that Mana ca n't be used inside if nobody can manifest Mana in here then the main family and the branch ones can fight on equal footing Cayenne is still dumbfounded at what just happened and Eugene urges him to give up if he thinks that he wo n't win as he will just skip a beating Kenne looks at them and it 's seal who watches him with a glisten in her eyes he steals himself and thinks that he does n't need the sword AA to defeat this thing with that he valiantly charged in while it tries to grab him he manages to slash it and he does it a few more times but these are just surface wounds and they wo n't help much he Dodges its hand once again and aims for the leg but the Minotaur blocks access to it with its knee and manages to grab Cayenne it throws him away and Eugene notes that in the end end he 's still lost right Cayenne can only look at him and that 's when seal notes that she does n't want to fight as she ca n't use her sword Aura Eugene thinks that she 's much smarter than her brother and picks up his Weaponry while he makes his way towards the Minotaur seal asks if he really thinks he could win Eugene says that he does n't have the confidence to lose against such a beast he arrives in its attack range and wonders how he should put it down that 's when it attacks but he Dodges and attempts to climb its hand however it uses its other hand to try and grab him but is unsuccessful allowing Eugene to make his way to the top of its head it tries to punch him but he moves out of the way and it only punches itself this silences the Minotaur for a while giving Eugene the opportunity to strike constantly in the same spot the neck they all watch in amazement and desyra thinks that he 's hitting the same spot it 's cartoid with one final strike he makes the Beast gush its blood all over the place and it falls down the this battle has been won he removes the blood from his sword and asks Kion if he saw that who does n't even know what to say he finally says that he should n't be so proud as he would have also been able to kill that thing if he had his sword AA he thinks that what he says is true but he certainly would n't have been able to do it like he did this feeling that he holds now is different from fear and he ca n't really hold his excitement any longer what could this feeling really be the Labyrinth slowly begins to dematerialize and seal notes that the ritual is officially over Gillard and reran watch as this happens and Gillard finds it incredible that a child from a branch family no less managed to take down a Minotaur just by himself ruran sweats a bit and notes that the minur is a monster that is difficult to deal with alone and that 's why the succession ritual this time was about teamwork so the children could try and defeated in numerous ways together that 's how it was supposed to be anyway that single child was also able bble to break through the numerous traps he set with ease just who is he Gillard smiles and notes that Eugene trained a lot and repeatedly even with him being here at the main Family Residence he also sent people to gual his town to collect some information on him and he 's also famous for his persistence this child has an exceptional marital physique and his personality also suits this he 's a gem who was only found because of the ritual robertin asks if he 's not mad as he does n't mean anything by it but Eugene stands out far more than his children so if there 's such a gap already when he trains with Mana his strength potential is near infinite Gillard says that it 's a great thing as because of him the Lion Heart name Will Shine even further right robertin with a heavy breath asks what will happen if he wants to become patriarch Gillard looks at him silently for a second and notes that it 's only fair that the strongest one of all becomes patriarch as if his children ca n't hold the position there 's nothing they can really do about it if they are that weak to have their birthrights snatched away from them then they did n't deserve it in the first place robertin notes that he probably should n't talk about this since he 's an outsider and dematerializes the tent they were in he also says that they have been friends for a long time so he would at least give him some advice he should adopt that kid Gillard is surprised by this notion and reran notes that a child from a branch family managed to outclass the main family and a lot of Branch families will laugh away just because of that and some Insidious people will even start Gathering Together Gillard thanks him for the idea and says that it is indeed an interesting one but they should congratulate them first and foremost that 's when the kids make their way out of the forest they all line up and gilard looks at iot who could n't even make it to the center because of how distracted he was by the various Magics around him he is a bit disappointed that his curiosity came first for him instead of proving his worth as the ritual intended on the other side Kenne and seal made it to the center and were n't held back by the traps and monsters thrown at them they could n't defeat the Minotaur outright but they are still immature and that can be made up for in the future when they age he congratulates everyone for doing well and says that he watched all of them throughout their Journeys and is proud he starts speaking with Eugene and notes that out of all the children who were in the ritual he would is by far the most impressive Eugene thanks him for the praise and Gillard says that his methods for dealing with traps and monsters were nothing short of amazing especially the one-on-one fight he had with the troll which he got out of with no injuries this surprised gargas who wonders how he managed to not sustain any injuries with that scrawny body of his but it 's quite unfortunate as if he had the muscle growth potion he offered him he would have been able to build a temple from his body robertin says that if he 's honest he thought this ritual would have taken at least a few days but it seems that he 's underestimated them quite a bit he thinks that even though they are quite young they are still descendants of the great bloodline and it certainly shows it is also quite fortunate that he has the opportunity to watch these gemstones which have such a shine to them Gillard urges everyone to rest as he would have liked to welcome them with a banquet but they passed everyone 's expectations so he did n't have time to prepare one in advance he asks bertan to take the children back and he begins doing so but that 's when Gillard calls Eugene to his side as he will be coming with him this catches Seal 's attention and she asks if he 's going to give him the present now Gillard says that there 's no reason not to and it 's more exciting for the both of them if he gives it sooner seal thinks that she\",\n",
       " \"'s pleaded with her father many times to let her into the underground treasury but he never allowed her in and now she can only look at the both of them while walking towards it Gillard notes that it seems like he can use various weapons Eugene says that he 's just overestimating his abilities but Gillard says otherwise he used a sword and shield in The Labyrinth and a spear to battle cayenne and desyra Eugene thinks that he found out about his match with desyra which is n't surprising as he 's the patriarch after all Gillard notes that the sword is the weapon that symbolizes the lionart family now but their ancestor vermouth wielded multiple weapons and skillfully at that that 's why he was called the god of War and the master of all but vermouth was n't the only one who was able to wield various weapons His companion Hamill was the second most skilled after vermouth of course Eugene clears his throat and notes that in the children 's book He read Hamill was called foolish Gillard laughs and says that he also read that book when he was young but if it were n't for Hamill causing trouble the book would have been quite boring right and if he 's honest he liked Hamill more than vermouth this surprises Eugene and he wants to know why Gillard notes that he liked that Hamill was more human compared to the Untouchable vermouth as it was shown in the book quite often Hamill always felt inferior to Vermouth but was never discouraged and instead he always overcame his shortcomings and in his last moment he sacrificed himself for his companions in the whole world Eugene thinks that children 's books emphasize things to teach kids about stuff he smiles and says that he also liked Hamill the most thinking that if it feels good it should be appreciated they arrive at the Vault and the guards bow down while they let gilard in they make their way down the steps and Gillard says that he 's the first person who is n't a patriarch to enter this place Eugene asks if it 's really fine for him to be here and Gillard confirms this as he already promised something from here right and the situation has also been discussed with the Elders of the Senate Eugene knows about them they are the old Lions of lionart and including the previous patriarch it 's something even people with great status in the branch families are affiliated with he asks what the contents of the treasury are and Gillard notes that it 's inheritance has been accumulated throughout hundreds of years and among them are also things left behind by the great vermouth himself Eugene asks if the sacred sword is also being kept here and Gillard confirms this but he ca n't have it as it 's the symbol of the Lion Heart bloodline and nobody can own it Eugene notes that it 's quite unfortunate and Gillard says that this is not the only reason as after vermouth passed away nobody was acknowledged by the sacred sword Eugene wonders what that is about and gilard notes that he will get it when he holds the sword they arrive at the door of the Vault and Gillard bites his own finger and puts a few droplets of blood into a container allowing the door to open Gillard urges him to enter and he will wait here as if he were to enter with him he would be conscious of his presence and would n't be able to choose what he truly wanted Eugene thank thanks him for the consideration and so he walks in the door closes behind him and he smirks his first objective is to grab the sacred sword this sword has existed since the mythical ages in the Holy Empire of Urus and it is known as an item bestowed by God the sword which had been sealed for a good while in the central Temple recognized vermouth as its owner instantly this sword pierced the heart of helman 's fifth ranked demon king of Slaughter 300 years ago but after that it was basically an oversized torch he tries to yank it out of the ground but it does n't budge and Eugene thinks that even if he somehow managed to draw it he could n't keep it so he should give up and look for something else he begins to look around and spots the Devourer sword it 's a sword that devours the Mana of what it kills and makes it its own it can also split strong magic with one single hit but the reason vermouth was able to handle it was because he was also a talented Mage so it 's too much for him currently but there are many familiar weapons in here the dragon spear carbos is a weapon comparable to a dragon 's breath though quite slow to warm up the Windstorm sword wiad was blessed by the king of wind Spirits the lightning bow peroia which is able to call down a lightning strike no matter the distance the sword of no return zel when imbued with magic plits into pieces and forms a formidable whip The Shield of gadon can send any attack it receives into the void there 's nothing here that would really disappoint him were he to pick them but is this really all they have what about the Demonic spear or the Moonlight sword but it has been 300 years so they naturally took the most overpowered weapons for themselves the greedy bastards while thinking he comes to the conclusion that the most suitable weapon for him now would be winned as he can summon wind Spirits with it and also their King if he had enough Mana that is Spirit magic is hard to get into as without Talent not even a skilled Mage can control a single low-grade spirit however with winned that should n't be an issue but since he 's in the treasury he should look around more as he might find something else he gets to the place where accessories and jewels are being held and spots a necklace which he immediately snatches this is the same necklace he wore in his past life as haml it 's a Keepsake from his parents who were both butchered by a monster of course he had his revenge but even so he wore this necklace until the day he passed away why would this be here did vermouth really recover his body but he also would n't just leave it there to rot the promise made between the demon of incarceration and vermouth brought peace to the world but the two remaining demon kings are still alive in helmet because of this they all promised to kill the five demon Kings together but just what kind of Promise did they make and also leaving his Keepsake here just what was that vermouth thinking perhaps it was his fault as maybe there was n't enough manpower to defeat the the demon Kings after his death he does n't need or want to resent vermouth and his companions as there must be a good reason they did n't kill the Demon King there are many weapons that he would like from this treasury but he ca n't leave this Hamill 's Keepsake to gather dust in the lionard treasury he comes out of the Vault and Gillard is surprised by his Choice Eugene notes that this is what he liked the most and Gillard says that there are countless Treasures in there but Eugene notes that they are too much to handle for him currently gilard asks to have a look at the necklace and notes that it 's just a simple crude necklace with nothing special about it so why would this be in the treasury he points it at the lion 's head and it emanates red from its eyes Gillard notes that this necklace is n't registered in the treasury and should n't have been there Gillard says that this necklace holds no real value and he would n't be able to buy a cheap sword if he were to sell it does he really want such a thing Eugene says that he does and gilard notes that it ca n't be helped then but he will have robertin analyze it since it came from an unknown source and might be imbued with magic Eugene asks if he can have it after and Gillard promises that it will end up in his hands he also says that since things turned out this way and this item is technically not a Lion Heart treasure why does n't he go back inside and choose another treasure Eugene asks if he can really do that and Gillard confirms\",\n",
       " \"it as he promised he would let him choose one treasure from here Eugene thanks him and immediately goes in in while thinking that he 's quite flexible a surprising characteristic from a descendant of vermouth but this time there 's no need to hesitate and so he grabs wined he gets it out of its sheath and thinks that now this sword is his that night desyra bashes him for not choosing a spear as he 's extremely good with that type of weapon Eugene says that it was his choice and he 's good with swords as she saw at the ritual gargas thinks that it 's too light and considering his strength he should have picked something heavier like a hammer or an axe but now that the succession ritual is over why does n't he come back with him as he will provide all of the muscle growth potions he wishes Eugene screams that he does n't need them and desyra demands he stop talking with this Meathead and draw his sword Eugene does so and she asks what kind of Sword it is he notes it 's the winad and according to the patriarch the blessing of the windspirit king is imbued within and can most likely summon him after he gains enough Mana desyra says that it is a cool sword but she still thinks he should have gotten a spear Eugene says that there were also a lot of Spears in there and she asks if he saw them the dragon spear is carbos which apparently lets out a fire breath Eugene lies and notes that he does n't know what it looks like she asks about the Demonic spear rusos which is the strongest weapon vermouth used gargas says that he also knows of that spear as it was used by the demon king of Cruelty this makes Eugene think think about it and 300 years ago there were five demon Kings in helmet rank one demon king of Ruin rank two incarceration rank three frenzy rank four cruelty and rank five Slaughter gargas notes that desyra is wrong as the strongest weapon used by vermouth was the pulverizing flail zigal Ard which was used by the demon king of Slaughter they start bickering about their favorite items and Eugene thinks that he also did n't see that flail in the treasury of the many weapons vermouth used the ones he got from the demon kings were the spear and the flail they are both way too scary to be held in the treasury so maybe they were sealed somewhere else the other two are still arguing and Eugene notices how childish they are so he leaves he notes that both the spear and flail are great weapons so it 's hard to say which is better but if someone were to ask him which weapon used by vermouth was best he could answer within a second the Moonlight sword which is the fragment in the shape of a sword that was sealed away even in the demon realm both the demon king of Cruelty who used the spear and the king of Slaughter who used the flail were defeated by the Moonlight sword he looks at wiid and thinks that this is the first real weapon he is using in this life gargas and desyra look at him and he begins practicing with it almost as if he 's performing a dance they 're both mesmerized by how beautiful that is in gillard 's office Roberti analyzes the necklace but finds no magic within is this thing really from the treasury Gillard confirms it and reran asks if Eugene is not just playing a prank Gillard notes that he would have no reason to as if he did n't allow him to get another treasure the child would still have gotten this reran notes that it is true that it would be too much of a risk but he would like to dig deeper as something is bothering him Gillard asks how he 's going to do it and reran says that there 's a magic that reads the memory of mana and it was created by by senya A Great Master in this field Mana exists everywhere and most things have it within them so he will begin reading the memory of the Mana that remains in this necklace Gillard says that he will leave it to him and so robertin begins doing it and sees nothing suspicious and what he can see is quite faint he notes that he ca n't read further as the magic from the treasury has stopped the memory of mana and that the necklace is at least a century old Gillard picks it up and not that there 's probably nobody alive to confirm where this came from robertin asks what he plans to do with it and he says that he will give it back to Eugene as it was an item that he was willing to sacrifice Treasures to get reran says that he likes him quite a bit and Gillard smiles and gets up he looks out of the window and says that there 's no reason not to like him and so he has a suggestion for him he will take Eugene lionhart in as an adopted child Keon lionhart comes to his Chambers and Eugene thinks that he 's the youngest brother of Gillard and considered a weirdo because he did n't marry yet despite being of marriable age and going around with Gillard on his journey he introduces himself but Keon notes that he already knows who he is as his performance in the ritual was amazing Eugene slowly removes his hand and asks if he 's here to pick him up Ken confirms it as Gillard wanted to send a knight but he wanted to come personally as he wanted to see Eugene for himself Eugene asks why and Keon notes that he already learned a lot about him but was n't able to see the ritual it 's ancient tradition that only the patriarch attends the ritual but this time it seems he made an exception for roarian since he helped in all however he should n't see this as him Throwing Shade at his brother he 's just saying how it is but now it also seems like he 's complaining about family Rules Eugene notes that he should n't worry about it and Keon says that his brother would have the same reaction Eugene looks at him and thinks that considering his mannerisms and free spiritedness he 's as free as it gets so that must be the reason he has n't found a partner yet while walking toward the patriarch 's location Eugene asks why he was summoned and Keon notes that it was probably to congratulate him on his accomplishments Eugene notes that he 's already been complimented plenty and it seems that even he does n't know the reason Keon says that it 's not like he could n't guess but it 's also something he just should n't get into they arrive at the door and he notes that he would like to talk with him more often Eugene thinks so as well knocks on the door and is a loud passage Kion gives him a final wink and Eugene thinks that he 's nice and all but it 's getting a bit much Gillard apologizes for summoning him without notifying him further and says they should sit down he puts the necklace on the table and notes that he made roarian look at it but it seems that it 's just a normal necklace they also tried to search its memory but nothing unusual could be found Eugene finds this surpr surprising as that magic is Sea 's handmade magic so she must have likely passed it down Eugene asks what kind of memories are inside and Gard explains that the necklace was simply sold on the streets of the capital hundreds of years ago Eugene finds this extremely strange as he 's very sure this is the necklace he wore as he had it on for decades roarian also has no reason to lie so did he perhaps make a mistake while reading the memories was there perhaps a spell cast on it that could trick even a magic Tower master but who would have cast it vermouth there 's too little information about this but he 's glad as now he can keep it right Gard notes that he did indeed promise that so he can have it Eugene puts it on and is happy to have it around his neck once again Gillard says that he indeed called him for the necklace but that 's not really the only reason he has an offer for him that 's not bad and might also be beneficial for\",\n",
       " \"his future Gillard tries to say what it is but Eugene stops him and notes that seal is cute and all but he has no intention of marrying someone just yet he thinks that since he defeated cenne she has started acting nicer towards him most likely to organize an arranged marriage he thought that the patriarch was a nice person but to think that he was this cunning he continues and says that he 's too young and would also need his father 's permission and all that gilard says that he misunderstood something as he was n't trying to force him into an arranged marriage with seal Eugene sits in silence for a second and blushes heavily as he makes the worst assumption ever now he just wants to beat himself up for just thinking of it Eugene asks what this is about and Gillard finally says that he wants to adopt him Eugene finds this just as shocking and thinks that it 's not that bad of an idea to tie him down to the main family Eugene notes that adoption is quite a surprising offer and Gillard says that it 's not as surprising as an arranged marriage right Eugene apologizes for that and Gillard notes that if he wishes he can can also get his father jard into the main family Eugene says that then he would have two fathers but Gillard does n't want this to become complicated and wants him to join the main family he 's a father of three himself so he would n't dare try to steal a child from his father and although he has never met jih hard before he will respect him as one of his brothers Eugene Ponders heavily and wonders what to do Eugene asks if he were to refuse this offer would his father lose his respect gilard denied this and gets up it 's a bit embarrassing to say this out loud but he 's not Petty and if he were to refuse that would be that he will respect whatever his decision might be and wish him the best in the future Eugene says that this decision is quite difficult so he needs to talk with his father about it Gard notes that they will decide after the banquet and he will have an Envoy sent to gual for his father Eugene thanks him and is lost in thought once again he suddenly asks what he meant by having a good future in the main family Gard notes that if he grows up in this main Family Residence he would enjoy many benefits and they also have a few Knights under their employment who would be able to teach him quite a lot of things Eugene says that if he 's ever adopted he wants to learn from the strongest person so if he becomes his son can he learn from him Gillard looks at him and Eugene thinks that this is the perfect opportunity to see how strong the patriarch really is Gillard smiles and notes that he could teach him but if he really want wants to learn from the strongest person here there 's someone else who fits that description perfectly Eugene asks who it might be and Gillard says that it 's Keon who has surpassed him for quite a while he also asks if his father taught him anything about mana and Eugene notes that he has n't told him anything yet because he told him not to tell him anything yet as he would have probably trained his Mana without wanting to Gillard notes that he 's been training every day since he got here without a skipped day he thinks that Mana Stone are crystals of Mana found within higher ranked monsters and it 's customary to get started with Mana with the help of a Mana Stone however the more efficient and big the monotone is the harder it is to obtain and for a person to really get the most out of it they also need someone capable all of this would put a strain on ji hard 's family and that environment is just too lacking for Eugene 's talent to truly shine he sits down and thinks that he ca n't tell Eugene all of this and cause unwarranted hatred towards his family so this will be discussed further with jard he says that they discussed what he wants and if that 's okay he would also like if they were to talk about things further Eugene accepts this offer and for a while they talk about all sorts of things Eugene decides to leave and Gillard says that he should bring someone to escort him back so he should wait a bit Eugene notes that it 's all right as the annex is not far away and he will head back alone to get some fresh air while walking towards his accommodation he notices the sent of perfume coming out from behind a corner and it 's quite potent it 's not moving so someone must clearly be waiting for him he continues to walk towards that place and that 's when anaila pops up and makes it seem like she was n't stalking him all of this time which he notices he plays along and introduces himself she says that she heard him and the patriarch have a discussion but it must have been quite long as she did n't notice he was still inside Eugene asks if she wants to say something to him and an ailla thinks that this child is already daring and quite arrogant to boot but it 's not in the least surprising as someone from a farm like him won against the main family and also claimed victory in the succession ritual he will surely experience Limitless growth in the future so it 's better to be friendly to him than an enemy also tying him down to the family with an arranged marriage using seal is not a bad idea and that 's precisely why she had seal stick around him she wonders what they talked about and Eugene notes that he should n't share the matters he discussed with the patriarch privately she forces a smile and says that it 's true but she 's not interrogating him here as she wanted to say something to him herself Eugene waits for what she wants to say and she apologizes for how disrespectful Cayenne was and also apologizes once again for not apologizing earlier Eugene notes that there 's no need for that as he 's already made peace with cayenne she says that he 's quite mature for his age and is also reled beli that he thinks this way she also made sure to give Cayenne a Stern warning so now she can only hope they get along in the future Eugene says that of course they will get along well they are a family that shares the same surname right an ailla stares at him intently and thinks that he 's not entirely wrong but it just feels wrong to be basically called family by this child he asks if he can leave and she allows him to do so noting that he should take a rest while walking away Eugene thinks that this is the same woman that tried to persecute him from the start because he was of a branch family so he should n't get involved with her if it 's not needed 2 Days Later jard arrives at the residence and looks around worrisomely did Eugene really win the success ritual his only son won against the well-trained Maine Family he showed such talent since he was young but he did n't have the ability to support that he thought that at the ritual he would have to face reality that the G between the branch and Main families is Stark and clear that 's when Eugene calls for him and waves with the patriarch next to him he immediately rushes over and Embraces him tightly he begins crying and says that he 's extremely proud to have someone like him as his son Eugene smiles and says that he already told him he would bring good news right jiar notes that he indeed said something like that and apologizes for not believing him earlier he also introduces himself to the patriarch and Gillard does the same to him also apologizing for the late invitation jard shakes his hand and says that it 's not an issue in the slightest as he 's just thankful he was invited in the first place Gillard says that he does n't want to take away family time but could they both have a chat inside jard agrees and so he walks away Gillard presents him with the offer of adoption and notes that if he were to adopt\",\n",
       " \"Eugene as his son he would also be included in the main family jard looks down for a second before getting up he says that he 's sorry if this comes across as disrespectful but as his father he ca n't help but worry about his son 's future here Gillard asks what kind of worries he has and jard explains that he 's worried the main family will harass Eugene he already has three children so if his son were adopted he would be considered a freeloader Gillard says that he understands as he also does n't want to limit Eugene 's future but the main family takes the legitimate bloodline extremely seriously and he 's almost sure they would n't just accept a child from a branch family so easily and additionally Eugene would n't be able to succeed in the patriarch position but as long as Eugene does n't become greedy his talent will truly Blossom if he were with the main family as his child Eugene would become closer to his other kids and a better future would be made for him as a result jard notes that all of this is correct but he at least wants to talk with his son about this first Eugene trains with his sword and his father pops up looking quite depressed Eugene notes that the news must have been quite shocking and he asks what that expression is about jard looks at him and spots that he has wined on his waist so that must be what he chose from the family treasury even if he were to sell everything he ever owned their family just would n't be able to afford that sword he looks away and says that the patriarch wants to adopt him Eugene says that he already knows that since he told him first and foremost jard notes that he would like for him to become his child as it is in his best interest for a better future however he may have to go through hard times later because of this Eugene scratches his head and says that it may be so but he already knows him Eugene lionhardt would never back down jard grabs him by the shoulders and says that he and his mother gave him that name and he should never forget that Eugene says that he knows and that even if he were adopted his real father would still be jard lionhardt jard hugs him tightly and thinks that it 's quite a pain that he 's being adopted but he would be gaining quite a lot so it 's quite worth it he also has no intention to become patriarch but nobody will really believe him so the first and second wives will surely try to keep him in check however there are two ways to deal with complaints and hostility ignore it outright or destroy them Gillard invited all the families of the children who underwent the ritual to the banquet and it was mostly to bless the victory of a branch family rather than focus on the shame brought upon the main family some people come up to jih hard and congratulate him on becoming part of the main family garg 's father also wants to give him their muscle growth potion if he 's interested Eugene looks at this and thinks it 's best not to mingle there as he would receive an annoying amount of attention an ailla and cayenne stand in a corner and she pushes him to be more confident as he will be compared to that person from now on and when they look at him they will only be reminded of the duel he lost they will also laugh that a main family member a direct descendant lost the succession ritual to a branch child cenne looks down and his mother says that it ca n't be helped and he needs to feel this embarrassment but should n't despair as even if people laugh and Bash him he 's still her son and a direct descendant she leans towards him and notes that Eugene ca n't become patriarch but he should n't feel relieved about this and instead try even harder while also becoming friends with Eugene cenne is surprised by this and asks if it 's because their sibling Lings an ailla notes that this is exactly why he must treat him like a brother so that he can help him later kayenne agrees with his mother but is a little shy and wonders how to become friends with him while eating some cake and following him around seal notes that they are siblings now so should n't he call her big sister by now Eugene notes that she 's only a few months older and she says that she 's the little sister because she was born seconds apart from Cayenne Eugene says that is entirely different and while she nags him to do it he thinks that he would rather bite his tongue and die than call this brat his big sister in the patriarch 's office roarian says that he ca n't take iode as his disciple unconditionally as at the red magic Tower summoning magic is the specialty and he will be tested for aptitude on that Iota asks what will happen if he does have an aptitude for that certain kind of magic and roarian says that it 's good but aroth still wo n't recognize the name lionhart unless he 's talented enough for him to disregard other aspiring m ages entirely he ca n't take him as a disciple iote agrees and is quite saddened by this but roarian notes that since he 's a longtime friend of the Patriarchs he will give him many opportunities he will be protected from discrimination and held in the environment most suitable for his preferred magic type IOD finds all of this exciting and thinks that even if he 's not his direct disciple it would n't matter he 's just happy to leave this nightmarish family and study magic in peace he looks at his father father who notes that there 's no need for reassurance and that it 's entirely his choice his mother says that this is a special opportunity his father has given him so he should take it with some Grace as he has shown interest in Magic ever since he was young but he should not forget that he is her son and the one who will become patriarch so even in the magical land of aroth he should n't forget this fact Gillard screams at her to stop and she says she 's only encouraging him as a mother should she thinks that bastard of a woman an illa will be jumping with joy when iode leaves but she does n't have any other choice as iode is too naive and weak willed to be called a descendant of this bloodline he 's much better off making connections with various Mages growing in power and making friends who will support him she reminds him that he 's a legitimate son of lionhart and he looks down while agreeing with her the only thing he can do the day after the banquet roarian left with iode for aoth and the other children of the branch families also returned to their own places Eugene and jih hard ended up living in the now empty Annex and today Eugene will be learning Mana for the first time after reincarnating Mana development has two categories breathing and body training breathing is where one collects Mana from the atmosphere with their breathing and body training is when one moves their body to collect Mana neither is easy but breathing is Superior in his past life he used body training to practice mana and later changed to breathing as sea and vermouth highlight advised The Lion Heart Mona training technique is breathing he arrives where Keon is waiting for him who says that they should get going and start Eugene thinks that manavan are the areas where Mana is most concentrated deep in the forest of the main family there 's a manavan that is only available to those of direct lineage it also was n't made naturally instead vermouth created it himself over 300 years ago he thinks that vermouth is the best person to create a manavan all by himself and Keon asks if he 's nerv nervous about this but it 's quite the opposite as he 's excited Keon notes that it wo n't be an easy task and he will help him but he may struggle as it 's his first time and he 's not that young yet to be able to feel the Mana at a higher potency he says that seal and cayenne started their training when they were just six and it only took them\",\n",
       " \"4 days to feel mana and iote around a week Branch families usually start training with Mana at his age but apparently it can take up to a month to even feel Mana however it wo n't take him that long as he 's here to help and they also have a Mana vein Eugene asks how long it will take and Keon guesses around 10 days Eugene scratches his head and laughs noting it wo n't even take him a mere 10 minutes finally they arrive at a lonely cabin they enter and Keon urges him to follow they go down a flight of stairs and arrive at a basement that 's quite large Keon tells him to sit in the middle and he does so he explains that their Mana training technique was passed down by the great vermouth and there 's a rule that Branch families ca n't use or inherit the technique so everyone in the branch families is taught the red flame method which lacks the utility of the original Keon shows him the original technique the White Flame method Eugen thinks that he has n't heard that name but he recognizes that unique form quite vividly vermouth had a high density layer of Mana that surrounded his body and it materialized in the form of pure white Flames it almost looked like the man of a lion and the past him was never able to really surpass those Flames Keon notes that since it will take a while for him to sense Mana they should concentrate on his breathing right now Eugene notes that he can actually feel it already but Keon says that it 's his imagination and uses a technique to teach him that it 's just his senses playing tricks he puts a ball of Mana around him and Eugene immediately points to where it is again and again until I asked how long they would be doing this for Keon is extremely surprised and thinks that this child is evolving at an extremely fast pace he sigh and crouches down to his level noting that if he already feels Mana they can start from this moment on he should n't say a word and concentrate on everything that 's going on inside of his body they begin and Keon urges him to imagine that he 's breathing in the same rhythmic flow that Mana has once he does that he should imagine that he 's guiding it along the proper path to his heart Keon lets go of him and slowly backs away noting that he 's doing very well but this does n't even cut it as Eugene is already capable of fine-tuning his Mana at such a young age and the only thing he needs to do now is allow the Mana within his body to flow fully while he meditates Eugene thinks that this growth is just plain crazy sensing and breathing Mana would n't have been hard for him to do in his past life but this body is like it was made for absorbing Mana he can feel how the amount of Mana within his body grows with every breath he takes but due to his young age there 's a limit to how much he can take so he should stop for now he makes a core in his chest and Keon notes that the size of his core is amazing as normal people start with a smaller core and train in Mana afterwards to grow its size he says that he 's a monster and Eugene asks if he meant that as a compliment Keon says that they should head back now and while they do so he says that the biggest difference between the White Flame and red flame methods is that the red flame ca n't spit out their cores with the White Flame method his core will split naturally once he passes a threshold he will be much more efficient with his use of mana and the cores will resonate with one another to increase their power by quite a lot they call those cores stars and vermouth the great had an extremely high number of 10 cores Gillard and himself are at six stars seal Sian and iode are all one stars but the twins will surely become two stars by the next year Eugene asks how long it will take him and Keon notes that if he does n't slack in his training he will grow much much faster he says that he will do his utmost and thinks that this is insane not only did he reincarnate into an extremely good body but he 's also learning vermouths training technique so there 's no way he will be lazy he is n't sure he will be able to reach 10 stars but he will figure out the details of the method later as he can adjust it as he wishes they arrive back and Keon know notes that he will be the one to tell Gillard what happened so he should get some rest Eugene says that he will do just that but he lies saying that there 's something he really wants to do first nah is surprised that he has already returned and he orders her to fetch vad for him he un sheaths The Sword and wonders if this will really work he imbus Mana into the sword and it starts a tornado which almost sends Nina flying inside of it someone talks with Eugene but calls him by his original name Hamill Eugene recognizes this voice and it 's none other than the king of the wind Spirits Tempest he instantly recognizes him as haml and Eugene asks how he knows Tempest notes that he could n't possibly forget one of routh 's companions Souls even if time passes and his body changes his soul will never truly change it 's also been quite a while since he last received win ad 's call he came here because he was curious as he thought one of routh 's descendants used it Eugene gets straight to the point and asks why vermouth did n't slay the Demon King he demands Tempest speak as he was still with them even after his death Tempest says that he ca n't hope to decipher vermouths mind but in the battle against the demon king of incarceration vermouth unexpectedly sheathed his sword Eugene is quite shocked at this fact and Tempest says the battle was the fiercest of all but the ending was lacking in that regard the only ones left standing were the demon king of incarceration and vermouth that 's when he chose to sheath his sword he did not slay the demon king and he left Eugene sits in silence for a second but he just ca n't believe that he notes that everyone here says that Vermouth made a promise to The Demon King so what was it Tempest notes that the only ones who know about said promise are the ones who were present when it occurred from the moment vermouth sheathed his sword he became unable to interfere in any way Eugene screams that he said everyone except the demon king of incarceration and vermouth died so is he telling him to get answers from a dead man Tempest says that he does not have time to answer as he forcefully opened a gate to talk with him which he now has to close they will meet at a later date when he has become strong enough while screaming Eugene falls down and the tornado dissipates nah sees him passed out and is extremely horrified later he wakes up in bed but a headache instantly Rises he thinks that this feeling means his Mana was depleted which is quite natural considering he had so little in the first place Spirits remember Creations by their souls and he recognized him as haml there 's always been the thought in the back of his head that he 's not really haml but just a creation from his memories but now he 's certain certain of who he is nah comes inside and notices that he woke up Eugene asks how long he was asleep for and she notes that it was about half a day she also says that the patriarch and Keon are in the annex as they speak so she will bring them here they arrive and Gillard says that he heard everything from nah about how a great wind blew around him the moment he held winad did he perhaps summon a wind spirit Eugene looks at him and thinks that he ca n't lie considering the size of the storm that a lot of people saw so he will have to tell the half truth he says that the king of wind Spirits descended surprising Keon quite a bit Eugene\",\n",
       " \"notes that he said he just wanted to see who called upon him as it 's been a while since anyone truly has Keon says that nobody has been able to summon the King of wind Spirits since vermouth pass Eugene confirms it and also adds that he said he lacked power so he was looking forward to when they would meet again Gillard laughs and finds all of this nothing short of amazing he is truly an amazing child as he also heard from Keon about how he felt Mana instantly and his fast use of the White Flame method that alone can be considered a huge achievement but to know that he got some attention from the great king of wind Spirits amazing Eugene smiles and Gillard notes that Keon will teach him once he has rested for a few days originally he wanted to begin training after the blood sacrifice ritual however right now the most important thing they should do is support his growth as much as they can Eugene says that he appreciates it deeply but also does n't want to bother Keon that much he notes that it 's no bother as he wants to teach him personally he will also be teaching cayenne and seal and the patriarch will come and help whenever he can Gillard still smiles and thinks that it would be quite nice if this were to motivate Kenne and seal to be better they are at the training grounds where seal says that Eugene just became a white flame one star Cayenne notes that he knew already but seal says that it took them basically forever to become that Cayenne gets Furious and says that it was n't forever as even among their ancestors one month is extremely fast they both think that in one meager day Eugene was able to become a whole star and so after this conversation they begin training Eugene sits silently in his room waiting for everyone to leave and when they do he immediately picks up the wied and un sheathes it from the tip of the sword a Sil comes out which is a low-grade Spirit but this is probably the most he can do with his current Mana he asks her if she 's heard anything from the King but she does n't respond and he thinks that they are n't intelligent so he probably ca n't have a conversation with one of them so naturally he resorts to threats a language that has no barrier telling the sil that he 's going to kill Tempest if he finds out he was lying the Fairy does n't like his attitude one bit and she flies away through his hair Eugene thinks that he was the only one to die in the demon king of incarceration Castle as all of his comrades excluding vermouth were revived in the demon real helmet the only ones who truly know about the promise are either the demon king of incarceration or vermouth he will have to visit helmet someday but not just that aoth Urus and luhar maybe in these places he will be able to find traces of his long lost companions however in his current state he ca n't as he still has a child 's body but one day he surely will while looking into the mirror Eugene notes that time sure does fly fast as he 's now 177 years old he thinks that it 's quite nice to have such a pleasant body but he did train in Mana every day after all he 's also a three- star White Flame but this is n't really enough as to use this Temple of a body he will have to learn things that he did n't in his past life while doing their daily training Eugene tells cenne that he will go to aroth to learn magic cenne wants to know how he can spout such nonsense out of his mouth and Eugene says that this very morning he was training as usual with the White Flame method and suddenly he could do this he spins the Stars into his body in Rapid motion and white energy envelops every crevice of his body Cayenne is extremely shocked and asks how such a thing could be possible this guy started training Mana s years later than him but he 's already a three star while he remains a lowly two star Eugene notes that yes it is indeed impossible but he 's a genius cenne says that he wants him dead but Eugene notes that they ca n't do that since they are brothers Kenne says that he beats him up like he 's going to really kill him every single morning Eugene notes that he was the one to invite him to training every single morning so they can stop if he really wants to Cayenne avoids his gaze and asks why he wants to learn magic all of a sudden has he really forgotten what happened to iode he followed roarian to aroth to learn magic after the secession ritual and could n't even come close to becoming his disciple as he was n't that talented he 's basically been a burden for iode these last couple of years because he could n't achieve a single thing despite his many connections Eugene notes that he just says whatever comes through his thick head but Cayenne feels he did n't say anything wrong however he just stayed at the main house and trained instead of arrogantly trying to learn magic if he were to go to aroth right now seal might be upset Eugene laughs and notes that she stopped talking to him a while ago and started training by herself shortly after he drops his sword and leaves causing cenne to ask where he 's going Eugene says that he will be going to the patriarch and telling him about his wishes and how he became a three star Kenne can only feel like a shadow before this guy and he wonders why he also wants to learn magic now Gillard is quite surprised by his request and asks if he truly means what he just said Eugene confirms that indeed he wants to go to aroth and learn magic Gillard demands to know why that is as no one in their whole ancestry has managed to become a three at his age if he were to continue like this it might be possible for him to even become a fourstar before he becomes an adult Eugene notes that he realized something when he became a three star student mere training as he 's been doing wo n't be enough considering how much growth he has he wants to learn many things and does n't know if he really has talent for magic but if he were learning it he may have a New Perspective when it comes to Mana all around it would be a great experience for him to learn a new subject and not at all a meaningless venture he bows down to the patriarch who thinks a bit before looking at him he asks him to raise his head and says he ca n't deny such passion for learning even as a patriarch but he must promise him one thing not to get involved with dark magic in a Roth there is a dark magic Tower with dark Mages unlike in the past there are n't any rumors and people no longer look at those people in a negative light but Lion Heart Is the bloodline of the great vermouth so naturally dark magic is forbidden and frowned upon even if it 's not directly written in their laws Eugene looks down and he knows all too well that dark magic is the source of all evil and that only cruel things can come from it he tells Gillard that there 's no cause for concern on that part as he hates dark magic with a passion while walking away someone knocks on a door it 's seal who notes that she wants to talk with him he notes that she can come out here if she really wants to talk but she denies it as she smells of sweat due to the training she asks if he 's truly going to aoth and he in turn asks if cenne told her she confirms this and also says that she knows about him being a three star as well but why is he leaving Eugene says that he wants to study magic but she notes that he has Spirit magic and they could also just invite a mage from the capital however the most important thing would be that she and cayenne would catch up to his skill level while he was gone Eugene says that he 's quite fine with that as it will be\",\n",
       " \"much more fun training with them if that were to happen but it 's also been a while since they last fought seal blushes and asks if he will still go to aoth if they are to spar from now on Eugene says that he 's still going no matter what and she calls him a bastard while also asking how long he will leave for Eugene says that he will know when he gets there but for a few years at least she wonders why he wants to leave for so long as nothing good comes out of leaving home Eugene can only sigh and seal also asks about his father jard Eugene notes that he will be just fine without him as he 's used to the main family lifestyle and has lost weight from regular hunting as well she still tries to make him stay noting that Keon or her brother will be upset but Eugene assures her that he will still be going and wishes her good luck with her training while walking away she pops her head out of the door and asks if he will truly be going one last time he just waved her goodbye making her quite sad as she also did n't want him to go on the day of departure Eugene talks with his father who urges him to not go around bad influences even while in aoth and to study diligently Eugene in turn says that he should n't lay around during his exercise because he 's not here his father laughs and gets up noticing just how much taller he is now but most important of all he should just take care of himself they all see him off at the portal gate and gilard asks if he really does n't want any guards to go with him Eugene says no as he 's quite confident in his ability to defend himself gilard thinks that he 's already three stars so he should be fine which is not something he can say for iode his father begins sobbing uncontrollably and Eugene urges him to stop as he was acting Brave earlier so what happened now it 's not like he will change his mind because he 's crying so he should at least say goodbye to his son with a smile on his face right through the tears he finally manages to pull out a smile which Eugene appreciates he turns to the gate and with a last farewell leaves he arrives at the Mage Kingdom of aro 's capital Pentagon the Five magic Towers here create a pentagram with the castle at its core Eugene rides around in a flying vehicle of sorts and thinks that he 's been to iroth in his past life as well but it 's much much different for starters it has a floating station and out of all the kingdoms aroth is the only one that keeps a warp gate in the sky the stations held up by lots of different and unique Magics symbolize the greatness of aro 's magic while also being convenient and very marketable his tour guide notes that this view is the best part of a Roth to him at least he also notes that the Pentagon has 15 floating stations and all were made by the great and wise senya Eugene fakes a reaction and asks if this Carriage is also made by her the tour guide confirms this and notes that he should n't worry about safety as it uses Magic from hundreds of years ago but is maintained regularly so naturally the acid rate is very low he wants to talk about tour spots but Eugene stops him and notes that first and foremost he wants to visit Sea 's Mansion the tour guide says that he made a great choice as in the Pentagon one must see these three things senya 's Mansion the magic towers and the stunning view at night they make their way there above the streets and the guide notes that 300 years ago Sena was able to become the youngest magic Tower Master after coming back from the demon realm due to that there 's a big statue of her in the green magic Towers Square the Mansion they are going to is where she stayed until the very end 200 years ago she left her Mansion leaving behind only a letter that said that she was retiring Eugene notes that it must n't be known where she went and the guide confirms this as countless Mages including her disciple tried to desperately track her down but none were able to find her whereabouts the worst part of this is that she went missing on her birthday and this is only his opinion but he thinks she went to the demon realm with helmod Eugene asks why he thinks so and the guide notes that 200 years ago marked the 100th year after she regrettably Left Behind Hamill 's body to rot so he must have gone to that exact same spot Sena was just thinking of her dead companion and she wanted to avenge him that 's what really made her leave he knows too well about how Hamill on his deathbed confessed his real feelings to seya Eugene gets extremely mad and demands he stopped talking crap the guide is quite surprised by his reaction and Eugene tries to recover the situation as he lashed out quite harshly the guide says that he must not like the romance side of the story but there are many other theories as to where she went it 's known quite well that she hated anything that was related to dark magic and demons as she was against the dark magic tower being built until she left some speculate that dark Mages who wanted to see that project done assassinated her Eugene says that a lowly dark Mage could n't hope to kill s the guide agrees and notes that this theory was also widely rejected at the time Eugene thinks that a dark Mage is nothing against her but a demon king is a whole different story helmet is still sponsoring aoth through the dark magic Tower so senya 's being alive most likely bothered them quite a lot enough to want her death that is they arrive at the mansion and Eugene ca n't help but wonder if his comrade is truly dead at the entrance of the Mansion countless students pray to pass their tests as even in the magical world one ca n't escape the hellish reality of exams Eugene is surprised at the number of people gathered here and the guide explains that these are students ready for the magic recruitment test but none of them can go in because they are to put it bluntly poor just entering the Mansion costs thousands of cells and that 's only for the garden you have to pay much more than that to go inside Eugene wonders why it 's so expensive and the guide says it 's because there 's demand for it as people really want to see it there 's also a myth that if one prays to senya 's portrait in the center of the Mansion they will surely pass their recruitment exam Eugene gives the guard his ID and spots that he 's from the lionard family they immediately let him inside and the guide waited for him at the door it closes behind him and Eugene can now freely see just how that bastard of a woman lived while walking through the mansion He thinks that it 's quite huge and it 's said that seya lived here for 100 years he remembers the day when she asked what he wanted to do in the future and it surprised him quite a lot he wants to know why she wants to know and she notes that just because they have basically the worst jobs for their age so he needs to find something to do that will bring him happiness once all of this is over Hamill says that he never really thought about it and senya notes that [ __ ] said he wanted to become a king of all things Hamill says that he 's just a crazy guy as you ca n't just become a king like that senya notes that they should leave them be as people are allowed to dream about what they want Hamill asks if she 's drunk to say such cringy things with such a straight face seya curses at him as she was trying to be serious for a moment here and he asks what her plans are for that peaceful future she 's hesitant to answer and while Eugene stares at her portrait he thinks of it she wanted an average life like other people where she would get married\",\n",
       " \"have a kid and eventually become a grandma he thinks that he should have done that and achieved her dreams so why did she decide to live for so many years he tries to touch the portrait but a keen eyed guard spots him and says that touching is not allowed Eugene curses at him for ruining his emotional moment and walks away thinking that he 's not only here for portraits but for the huge library that she has he arrives there and touches the countless books noting that there might be a clue somewhere around here the guard followed him and says that is n't touchable either Eugene scratches his head and thinks that the only Clues he will be getting will be from the book titles he also thinks about his necklace which shared countless memories with him but was just locked up unregistered in the treasury and it just happened to catch his eye there 's no way it 's just a coincidence perhaps just as the Tempest recognized him so did the necklace show up because of his soul someone messed around with his reincarnation and if it was seya she would have left something right later he makes his way back to the portrait and thinks that he scowled every nook and cranny of this place but nothing was found now that he can only do whatever he wants as he has no instructions from her or anyone else what is he supposed to be doing with zero information he sees the guard turn his back on him and he flips SAA off noting that if she does n't like it she can come and find him herself if she 's alive that is it is now night and the guide is quite surprised and tired that he spent so much time in the Mansion Eugene hands him a golden coin for making him wait and the guide asks where to go next as there are a lot of famous tourist spots and amazing restaurants everywhere Eugene notes that they should go to the red magic tower now and he does n't need to guide him afterwards while they ride there Eugene asks him if he knows anything about EOD lionhart the guide says that there 's nobody in the Pentagon who does n't know his name and Eugene notes that he 's staying at the red magic Tower and his older brother has been in aoth for 4 years already could he perhaps tell him any rumors about him the guide is hesitant to say anything and Eugene notes that after his adoption he did n't get to talk with his brother IO at once so he needs to know something about him to at least make conversation he promises not to be angered by his words nor will his family or anyone else he swears by his name all he needs to do is tell him rumors about his brother the guide says that he does n't know that much but it 's said that IOD leaves the magic Tower every night seeking pleasure Eugene thinks that he 's 19 now so he 's allowed some pleasure right the guide explains that it 's not normal pleasure it 's succubus pleasure Eugene immediately gets Furious and demands to know why the hell there a succubi here the guide calms him now and notes that although they are not in helmet the dark magic Tower exists and it also holds quite a few demons as well Eugene finds his brother shameful and asks if his older brother is really playing around with a succubus the guide explains that it 's not for fooling around but rather for pleasure like any other city aoth also has a dark alleyway that acts as is a necessary evil here it 's famous for its Black Market but there are a few stores that make succubi serve as waitresses and rumor has it that iode visits them quite regularly Eugene asks where that alley is and what its name is the guide says its name Bolero Valley is not open during the day and only becomes a red light district on red moons specifically Eugene thinks he was n't planning to meddle with iode much and focus more on his studies while keeping a good distance but this rat bastard who calls himself vermouths descendant is fooling around with a demon just how low has he stooped the guide asks him to keep what they talk about a secret and Eugene notes that he already swore on his name so he wo n't tell anyone not even that excuse of an older brother Eugene notes that these are rumors for now so unless he comes across clear evidence of this he has to refrain from slapping the snot out of him on the night of a full moon in Bolero alley he will be there Eugene arrives at the door of the red Tower and a woman by the name of Hera greets him she notes that the owner reran is waiting above as he had planned to come greet him but something really minor occurred that 's when an explosion happens from above and Eugene asks if there 's something going on Hara says that he probably knows this but the red magic Tower focuses mostly on summoning magic which is by and large the magic with the highest possibility of failure two dark spirits come out of the blown out window but two red hands catch them and squeeze the life out of them it was Roberti who looked in disgust at his students noting that they were really Geniuses how did they even managed to summon Shadow beasts from a lava shark summoning Circle do they even comprehend what would have happened if those creatures ran loose Shadow beasts hold a real form of intelligence and are mostly driven by Instinct so they would have started hunting people instantly they try to apologize but reran demands they pack their bags and leave now that 's when he spots Eugene and slowly descends to the ground as if he were another person he greets him warmly and notes how much he 's grown over the years Eugene says he looks the same as always robertia notes that it 's because he 's preserving his youth with magic and Eugene takes a closer look at him as he must have been training with Mana up until now he 's strong not even close to seya though but definitely for a tower Master Roberton says that he heard from Gard that he 's quite interested in Magic is that correct Eugene confirms this and reran notes that it 's truly an interesting and Charming subject but it 's much harder to learn than most things that 's when he notices something 's wrong and swings the tower doors open with just a glance it seems that the rat iode is spying on them Eugene has to contain his anger as that bastard was going around town bragging that he fooled around with a damn succubus Roberton urges him to come and greet his brother and he 's quite hesitating he does n't know what to say Eugene coldly greets him and says that he 's looking forward to working together iode can only utter a simple reply and reran notes that if he 's done he can go upstairs and read a book or something he Retreats back into the tower slowly and robertin apologizes for letting him see such a sorry sight Eugene says that it 's all right and Rober notes that according to Gillard he did n't want to learn magic from him right Eugene confirms it as he does n't want to bother the Tower master and if he were to learn directly from him many people would start to complain about the lion Hearts using their Authority that is precisely why he wants to learn magic on his own Roberti says that if he wishes so they will do it like that he wo n't intervene at all or make exceptions but if he ever needed anything he should ask Hera he says that he welcomes him inside the tower while he 's in a Roth and it 's not as luxurious as the Family Residence but it 's pretty decent all in all one month after being at the red magic Tower Eugene went to the library every single day not missing one he went to the library early to read up on Magic and returned to his Chambers late at night that does n't mean he only focused on Magic as he woke up extremely early to train his Mana before his trips to the library and trained his body every single night until he started sweating profusely naturally he was getting little sleep but his body somehow got rid\",\n",
       " \"of all the fatigue in just a few hours of sleep he thinks that he has read all of the books in the library so he should get started 300 years ago seya told everyone the steps of magic very clearly they were her own steps but after she became the green magic Tower Master at such a ripe age countless Mages imitated her methods the first step was a circle manipulating the Mana of the body into a ring and circulating it to manifest magic when the Mana of a circle hits its limit the circles automatically increase in number even after these 300 years most Magi are still using this circle method the only people who do n't are dark and spirit Mages who use completely different methods he arrives in a room where Hera is waiting for him and asks if they are starting with a circle Hera confirms this as it 's the most effective way even after 300 years Eugene notes that he wants to change it up a bit and Hara says that changing a method is not advised so how does he plan to do it she looks at him and notes that the Mana management used in magic and martial arts are Worlds Apart so without the proper Techni technique and chant magic wo n't manifest and he wo n't tell him this but if it fails he could get injured or Worse die Eugene says that this is why he wants to try it in the first place and he thinks that this is why he read all of those books in the library Hera thinks that he 's young so he wo n't get it unless he sees that it 's not working for himself he can try it but if she feels that something dangerous will occur she will have to intervene as if he were to get injured it would n't just affect her reput ation but the entire red magic Tower Eugene agrees and starts emanating Mana from his body he thinks that the White Flame method and the circle method have different ways to do them but in essence they are the same with the White Flame method Mana is handled through the stars of the heart with the circle method Mana is handled through a hook if he were to replace the circle with stars he could increase his Mana he can also control the Mana depending on what he needs so it would just be a a bother if he tried to predict how it would go and happen to be wrong Hera looks at him and ca n't believe her eyes he 's controlling such an amount of Mana perfectly it should just disappear but it does n't how is that even possible at his age Eugene summons a fireball and slowly transforms it into a magic Missile Hera thinks that he just did Magic that would require calculations in his head without even channeling it and he also manages to change the type of magic without dispelling it first Eugene thinks it 's not that bad for his first try and he asks Hera if she can summon a monster so that he can test the strength of his spells Hera thinks for a minute and says that a Golem should be fine and so she summons a Golem made out of cabum it wo n't defend itself but its exterior is quite tough enough to act as a natural defense mechanism Eugene finds this target great and he shoots the Golem with his magic Missile later Roberton comes to look at the scene and asks if Eugene really used the the White Flame method to make a circle using magic Hera confirms it and there were no impurities in the Mana disregarding the magic type his offensive strength is above the level of a third circle Mage Roberton thinks that this sort of talent is amazing as using martial art methods for Mana is n't just impressive but also quite scary Eugene is a white flame method three star so would he be wrong for thinking that the three star he has is equivalent to a magic third circle he sits down and asks Hera if Eugene is out now she confirms this noting that he left early in the morning as he had some things to attend to he also asks if it would be unwise to write an essay recommendation letter for Eugene she notes that the only people who can enter that Royal Library are Aristocrats high-ranking Mages and royalty Roberti says that Eugene is qualified enough as he has mastered the introductory texts within a month and used the circle as his core to use magic and with that he managed to piece together a whole hole through a cabri Golem so he will write a recommendation letter as such talent like his should n't be wasted on ifs and wise Hara says that other Mages will surely complain about this reran notes that if they were to it just means they are jealous and failed to see the truth behind his talent he also asks what plans Eugene has as he probably does n't know anyone in a Roth she notes that he went to meet a friend which reran finds quite strange in the mdan Square Eugene stares at a statue of senya and thinks that she did in fact smile that way when she achieved something that had to do with magic suddenly gargas appears and asks if it 's really him Eugene is quite shocked at his appearance and wonders if it 's really possible to have such a beard at the age of 18 gargas offers him a handshake and notes that he grew quite a lot but not as much as him Eugene says that he just grew too much and they shake hands gargas notes that he can tell just by holding his hand that he 's trained his body for the last 4 years at least but it 's clearly not enough so he should use his family 's secret muscle growth potion as he already brought it for him Eugene immediately rejects it but he still tries to give it to him as his father lost so much weight because of their methods and this potion he knows right Eugene just demands he stopped trying to send that weird potion to him through his father and asks why he wanted to meet as he presumes he did n't just come all this way to give him the potion gargas asks if he knows anything about Bolero Aly and Eugene says that he knows a bit thinking that is the place iode visits to have his little fun gargas notes that he heard a great rumor that a Giant 's testicles are up for auction there Eugene ca n't believe what he just heard and gargas unfortunately repeats himself Eugene asks why he would ever want those things and gargas says that a Giant 's gems have great value among Mages so he wants to take them and make a custom muscle growth potion from them by giving them to a famous Alchemist in aoth they should go to the auction together as he brought a ton of cash but even that might not be be enough Eugene asks in what world he would just lend him money and that 's when gargas lands straight on his knees and begs Eugene urges him to stop as he already attracts way too much attention with his big body so he will just lend him some money gargas thanks him and swears that he will pay it back with interest if needed he also heard that there would be many high value items at the auction other than the Giant 's gems Eugene just scoffs and gargas wonders why he 's not interested but he does have Winnie so he would n't care for other weapons he notes that he 's just interested in the street itself and thinks that he saw iode in the tower a few days ago and he was showing clear withdrawal from the succubus this coming full moon iode will definitely be there later Roberton summons him as soon as he enters the magic Tower but he finds this perfect timing since he also wanted to ask something about Iota he arrives and reran urges him to take a seat and make himself comfortable he does so and he asks why he called for him reran hands him a letter using magic and Eugene is extremely surprised to find that this is a letter of recommendation for acon the Royal Library of acrion was famous even 300 years ago because aro 's Pride the essence of magic was kept there however many of the magic texts that are kept in the magic Towers ca n't even\",\n",
       " \"compare to the quality of those in acon he thinks that he must be humble and says that at the moment this may be too much for him robertin notes that he actually thinks that now is the perfect opportunity for him he has n't even gone that deep into magic yet so he has Endless Possibilities even if he ca n't comprehend the texts in acon currently just reading them will help broaden his knowledge and someday that knowledge will turn him into an amazing Mage Eugene thinks that acrion contains ancient Magic from the mythical age as well as the Philosopher 's text deemed the best of its time he asks if senya 's texts are also kept there and ruran confirms it but the red magic Tower and the green magic Tower both keep senya 's texts the three original copies of the series of texts called witchcraft in which she wrote down all of her magic Essence in her last years are kept in acon the text witchcraft is considered the best set of magic texts in AR rooth 's history so naturally there are no copies of it only the first volume was ever publicized but even that should be good enough to broaden his knowledge in such a way that he wo n't need other texts when he first read the first volume of Witchcraft the stuff he learned from it made him feel like he was still a child of course this recommendation letter is n't a guarantee that he will gain entry into acrion but he wanted to hear his thoughts first would he be all right with him writing him a letter Eugene thinks that it 's very all right but in reality he sheepishly accepts it and acts like he does n't want to create any issues Roberton notes that he should n't worry about stuff like that as this much should n't be a problem for him Eugene thinks that this man is willingly writing him a letter so it should n't change his mind if he says something that might upset him right he hopes that a tower Master wo n't be that petty and finds the courage to ask he notes that he wants to inquire about something involving his brother iode it 's something that he heard when he first arrived here that his brother is not focusing on his studies but indulging in pleasure with all kinds of succubi in the red light district robertin reacts in a certain way making Eugene think that he surely knows something he says that he is n't sure how to tell him about this but it 's true and he has given him many warnings already but he has n't been able to stop these activities many men have died in the past because their Spirits were sucked out by the succubi but when helmet opened up to the public the attitudes of the demon king and the demons changed completely the succubi included as they still suck out the spirit from people but do n't kill like they used to the night witch Queen helmet forbids it Eugene notes that this does n't mean what his brother is doing is acceptable robaron knows that what he says is true but he should try to be somewhat understanding of him Eugene asks what he 's talking about and robertia notes that iode left the family residence for aoth four years ago and he came here with many expectations and High Hopes but his talent was n't enough so his hopes were crushed he 's experienced many failures the Mages tried their best to teach him but it was fruitless Endeavor IOD also had a ton of pressure on him due to his high status and that only grew the more time passed at first he thought it would be okay for him to loosen up a little and he gave him plenty of warning not to overdo it Eugene thinks that it 's not like he does n't understand this as he knows very well how it was to live in the main Family Residence as he 's done so for 4 years between the temperamental theonis as well as the cunning anilla and the twins who had plenty of talent IOD faced way too much much pressure for someone as young as himself the only reason he still stays in the red magic Tower despite the many criticisms people throw at him is most likely because it 's much better here than in the suffocating main Family Residence he knows the situation here is pitiful but messing around with succubi is just crossing the line even if they have changed somewhat demons are still demons at the end of the day they can never coexist alongside humans ever he will just have to see for himself exactly what he does with those succu by on the night of the full moon at Bolero alley gargas and Eugene who are now disguised walk the streets gargas asks why they need to use Transformation Magic like this and Eugene notes that they are children of the main family so if they were seen in this dirty and evil Place rumors would certainly spread gargas says that he 's right and that 's when a magic device Rings inside Eugene 's pocket and he picks it up the guide asks if he 's in and Eugene asks how he knew the guide notes that this device only connects within the Bolero alley area and now he will send him a signal when he spots iode Eugene asks if he can even find him as he will probably use Transformation Magic as well right the guide notes that he does no such thing as it said he always wears the same robe so it should be very easy to spot him even from a distance Eugene is a little angry that he 's exposing himself so openly and thinks that if he were his son he would beat the snot out of him to fix his behavior gargas says that he told him he had other business around here but Eugene notes that he will get to it on his own as right now they have an auction to attend balero alley holds a ton of auctions but they all follow the same simple rule Anonymous bidding other than companions everyone is guided to their own separate rooms and biders can not be identified by any means a Masked Man shows them how the auction works with the center button allowing them to bid the left for any assistance and the right if they wish to Inc increase the bid with that he wishes them good luck and leaves they sit down and gargas says that he thought he would n't be interested in the auction Eugene notes that he needs something to pass the time with and he 's quite curious as to what exactly will be auctioned the screen in front of them unveils the auctioneer who thanks everyone for coming all the way here on this beautiful full moon night their auction usually deals with magical materials and they resource the best especially if those magical materials come from helmet their first item is the Horn of ballar and the bidding will start at 10 million cells they go through countless precious materials like the fruit of proia the root of a mandre or even the flower butt of a yuz Eugene sigh and asks if what he 's looking for will even be here gargas confirms this as he has it on good authority that the item he wishes for will be here the next item is a metal that has n't been identified just yet and it 's quite bothersome as it 's just sitting in their storage perhaps among those who are participating today a few may be able to Value this metal Eugene says that he 's putting more emphasis on this item than the other ones and the auctioneer says that this metal was found in Helm 's khazard Hills when touched by the Moonlight it emits a beautiful light but other than that it holds no purpose as it 's too hard to be processed and does n't receive any sort of Mana either if one has a bed placed by the window it may serve as a great piece of Decor as the light it emits when it touches the Moonlight is very beautiful the box with the item slowly opens and Eugene notices what it is so he instantly smashes the bidding button gargas is quite surprised and the auctioneer asks how much he would like to bid Eugene says 1 million cells and thinks that he did n't know such an item would be here a dull colored blade basically destruction in the form of a single blade one\",\n",
       " \"that has n't been recorded in history This Is A Shard of the Moonlight sword he wins the item easily and gargi asks why he would even want something so useless in the first place Eugene picks it up and confirms that this is indeed a fragment of the Moonlight sword the place where they found it khazard Hills is where they found the Moonlight sword in his past life as they found it in the heart of an underground dungeon did vermouth perhaps go back and seal it there when he was leaving helmet it is true that this sword is way too dangerous as that sword only recognized vermouth as its owner and created mass destruction whenever it was swung perhaps vermouth recognized this as well and decided that it would be best if he just destroyed it he initially hoped that the fragment would still contain some power but it 's empty it does n't emit any sort of energy like it did 300 years ago and now it 's just a silent Rock he puts it in his pocket and that 's when the guide calls him as he spotted iode he tells gargas he 's leaving now who asks if he wo n't stay to watch the rest Eugene declines the offer and says that he will leave his card with with him so that he can bid on his item he gets out on the street and asks the guide for directions who tells him that if he goes north there should be a shop called Rafia That Should Be The Place Eugene arrives at the location and two large demons ask if he 's a customer he thinks that this is his first time seeing one after reincarnating and in his past life he would have slain them both Before Their Eyes could even meet he says that he would like passage inside and the demons explain that the entry fee is 2,000 cells with the fee being adjusted on the time taken and the type of dream he wants does he still want to enter Eugene hands them two bills and they welcome him with open arms inside many men are mingling with plenty of succubi and he sits down thinking that IOD does n't seem to be here he asks the succubus who just served him where he can dream and she smiles saying that he must be in quite a hurry she finds him quite adorable and it 's probably his first time here right he can dream in the basement rooms but first he should have a drink as he would Express his desires more honestly if he were to do so Eugene rejects the alcohol and wants to make his way down already the succubus thinks that what he wants may be too embarrassing for him to say here so they should make their way to a bedroom while they walk towards one Eugene says that it 's quite scary as he has n't done anything like this before the succubus says that he should n't worry about a thing as they will just take a bit of his energy and he will just be slightly tired the next day Eugene assessed how they built this basement up until now and thinks that his job here is done he hands her a bill and says that he only wants to sleep in his bed so he will just pay for the drink the succubus accepts him but finds him quite strange he also asks for the nearest exit and she points him to one that leads to a restaurant Eugene gets out and tells Incubus that he wants the best of the food menu and plenty of meat while having his meal Eugene spots someone being dragged around it 's that rat bastard I owed Eugene looks at that sorry sight of a man and wonders how the eldest son of the lionhart family descendants of the great vermouth managed to not only mingle with succubi but also receive support from the demons they continue to drag him out and Eugene slowly begins following them wondering where they could be dragging him out they move to a dark alley and drag him into an inconspicuous building Eugene notices and tries to enter but that 's when three men get in front of him and demand he get out of here or else Eugene asks what this place is and that 's when the bulkier of the three grabs him by the neck and tells him to get lost as this is no joking matter Eugene grabs his hand and notes that it does indeed seem like he 's joking around he punches him right in the chin sending the harasser right back to his men the other two pull their weapons out and get ready to avenge their fallen comrade they both strike at the same time but Eugene is too Swift so with a single hand take care of them both he tries to ask them what this place is but he did n't notice he knocked them out cold so he just decides to go inside himself to find out instead of opening the door silently he chooses to kick it open and notices that the smoke inside seems to be because of some drugs is iode indulging in that as well some people spot him and ask how he got in as there were supposed to be guards waiting outside Eugene finds the combination of a beastman human and Demon doing drugs together quite funny given the racial Harmony they have here they rush to eliminate this Intruder but with three Swift magic missiles he takes care of them Eugene asks where iote is but he 's hesitant to answer Eugene draws out his sword and says that he does n't need to answer anymore as he will just find him by his Lonesome out of the sword blasts of air come out and travel throughout the building but there seems to be nothing here Eugene thinks that with the first and second levels of this place cleared out the only logical place where iode would be is the third third level he blasts the floor open and Rises himself with the wind through it there is only one room on this level so iode must be inside something red begins emanating from the door and Eugene notices so he pulls out the Moonlight sword fragment the door blasts open with a dark and evil beam but the fragment protects Eugene quite well as even in this lowly form its characteristic of absorbing Mana is still here someone comes out of the room and Eugene notes that what he just used was dark magic is n't that right the man thinks that the beam he sent was supposed to kill him but something powerful managed to block it what could it be Gillard has told them specifically countless times that they should never get involved with dark magic yet his very firstborn vermouths own bloodline dared to do this he tells the man that he wo n't chase him or look for him if he leaves he should go away as he 's giving him this one chance Eugene starts spinning his Stars into a circular shape and white Flames emanate from his body the dark wizard did n't expect to see such a technique here and suddenly the demons that dragged iote and came out Eugene finds their presence quite funny and they extend their fingers into grotesque claws so he also gets ready to fight they both charge at the same time but with the help of winned Eugene manages to summon a small tornado that cuts one of the demons everywhere the other rushes to end the fight after seeing this but when he 's just about to strike Eugene cuts his hand and pushes him into the wall the transformation spell he used to hide himself slowly Fades and the dark wizard ca n't believe his eyes is this man really Eugene lionhart he notes that if he knows he must also know that now he must get out of his way the dark wizard tries to stop him to explain the situation but sees that this man is too stubborn to listen so he tries to attack him with a dark blast which is redirected quite easily Eugene charges in and the dark wizard can only wonder how this man managed to block that attack so easily the sword stops at his neck and Eugene demands he stay still as he will kill him if he tries anything he goes inside while sheathing his sword and spots iode standing in what seems to be a ritual Circle Eugene spots the Goblet thinking that it must be used for ritual and asks what 's inside of it the dark wizard says\",\n",
       " \"that it 's a unicorn heart with Eugene finding this quite surprising as they have such strong mana and divine power that they are off often called Divine water they are also very valuable especially for sacrifice he asks what they are trying to make a contract with the damn Demon King the dark wizard notes that he would n't dare even try and notes that it was for helmet 's Baron ulur Eugene demands to know who that is and the dark wizard says that it 's The Duchess Noir Jabba 's Incubus subordinate Eugene knows about her as she was alive even 300 years ago currently helmet is ruled through destruction and incarceration and this foul demon is no match for a demon king but she is the night witch Queen so the title of Duchess suits her so is iode really trying to make a contract with one of her subordinates a mere Incubus he 's even sacrificing a valuable unicorn heart and is also drugged and drunk out of his mind is all of this correct the dark wizard falls to his knees instantly and says that all of this was under iod 's direct command the large sum of money was also given by him so he could n't just ignore his request or rather order Eugene says that he must have been so Overjoyed to not be able to right the eldest of the lionheart family was giving him money and also asking him to make a contract with his master if this contract came to fruition he would have received a lot of power from that ulur bastard and perhaps Noir Scamp might have made a contract with him too right it was because of his endless greed that he wanted to do this so he should stop blaming others and be obedient if he does n't want to suffer an unfortunate fate the dark Wizard trembles and sweats profusely while Eugene looks at the sorry excuse of a lion heart he ca n't control himself any longer so he wakes him up by slapping him so hard that he recoils on the bed iodi wakes up with a scared expression and Eugene asks if he has finally come to his senses ioda asks what he 's doing here with a lowly voice and Eugene notes that he simply followed him he heard that he was having a hard time and that his situation was Dire so he tried to understand him as everyone needs breaks now and again however messing with dark magic is simply taking it too far as one of the direct descendants of the vermouth bloodline he dares try to form contracts with lowly demons and with an incubus iode says that it 's not something he could really control and Eugene headbutts him out of anger what does he mean by not being able to control it huh does he even know what happens when you contract with a demon his very Soul would have become the Demon 's play thing if it told him to die he would and if it told him to kill he would does he really not think of his family if he became a dark Mage the entire Lion heartt bloodline would be shamed but that 's not even the half of it as the demon he contracted with could have simply ordered him to kill his own family and steal their Treasures iote notes that they said he does n't need to follow orders that go against his ethics they promised this after all Eugene asks if he was dropped on the head while he was little as demons are not dragons or elves so promises mean Jack to them yes he does n't need to follow every order if he 's willing to risk his life to disobey them but could he really control that he who could n't even get his act together escaped Reality by indulging in alcohol and dreams iode sits in silence for a second and with teary eyes asks what he knows for him to insult him like this Eugene finds it funny that he stood up for himself and says he should just tell him about his worries iode explains that that he does n't know what it 's like as since 4 years ago he 's been the center of attention as the adopted son he got the support of the patriarch with everything he did so he should n't talk with him like he knows Eugene notes that he must think that he was discriminated against but actually they got the same amount of support he inherited the White Flame method and also had the opportunity to become the magic Tower Master 's direct disciple right iode tries to say something but Eugene continues talking does n't he get it by now the reason he 's better in every way is n't because the patriarch favored one over another but because he was just born better iode notes that Talent is something that he ca n't just get and Eugene says that it 's not only talent but hard work as well seal and cayenne are also working extremely hard at the main house while he 's indulging in every possible way here in aoth does he really think he will achieve the title of patriarch just by earning a reputation at the dark magic Tower IOD says that he never wanted to become patrio AR and he 's going to become a dark Mage in helmet in that place of Freedom his worth will finally be recognized Eugene punches him so hard that it sends him flying and demands he repeat what he just said a Lion Heart vermouths direct descendant recognized by demons in helmod does he really want people to recognize him over his own family does he think that 's worth anything he must be misunderstanding something here besides being the first son of lionard he holds absolutely no value he 's been given countless things others would kill for and he dares to feel bad for himself he has had enough of this facade so he will have to talk with roarian about it he arrives with some guards who take the dark wizard away roarian looks at iode with disgust and pity iode tries his best to defend himself noting that he did n't do it and that he did n't get into dark magic roarian says that he tried and on this day he has shamed the lion heartt name he has also insulted Lord Gillard who entrusted him to the red magic Tower and the Mages from it with him included iode says that he did n't mean for any of this but roarian demands he stop making lousy excuses or he will have to face punishment he should actually stop talking and direct the trash excuses that are coming out of his mouth at Gillard and theonis who sent him here out of the goodness of their hearts iod 's whole world crashed down on him and out of this he has no means to escape after midnight on that day roarian called Gil L and theonis to aroth as well as one additional person Balzac lbth the dark magic Tower Master Eugene who is also there thinks that this man held his position for decades and is one of the three legendary dark Mages who actually managed to sign a contract with the demon king of incarceration such a man is truly dangerous theonis asks how this man even dares to face them and roarian calms her down as he 's not related to this incident she screams that she knows he tried to introduce iode to dark magic before but now he is just not involved how can she believe something like this Bak says that the dark magic Tower is n't directly responsible for all the dark Mages in a Roth the dark Mage responsible for this very unfortunate incident was gavid and he 's not with the dark magic Tower but with the mag 's guild Theona still tries to confront him but Gillard shuts her up and notes that if the dark magic Tower really is n't involved why is their Master here bzac says that they must take at least some form of responsibility a few centuries ago even trying to learn about dark magic would get you executed on the spot but after the great vermouth came to an agreement with the demon king of incarceration people were allowed to do as they pleased the present is much different than the past as introducing black magic and making contracts are no longer crimes so he simply wants to respect the lionhart family 's wishes Gillard says that his words came out as unpleasant and as it sounds like he 's humbling himself before them even though\",\n",
       " \"he does n't need to bzac agrees but he also does n't want to have the lionheart family as an enemy because of a simple incident so he 's here to take responsibility the drug charges will be judged by aro 's laws with everyone at the drug Den being imprisoned and sanctions will also be imposed on the succubi theonas asks what kind of responsibility this is and bzac notes that for his crimes Baron olur the incubus contracted with Gavin will have his head cut off he summons a ball of dark energy and says that the demon king of imprisonment has something to say Eugene 's eyes widen at this information and Balzac applies some runes all around him he notes that the demon king is greatly displeased that vermouths direct descendants who he cherishes very dearly have become the target of objections that is why he has decided with heavy heart that oler 's head will come off Eugene begins to shake uncontrollably filled with rage did that bastard of a demon king really act like he cherishes the vermouth family Gillard is filled with the same rage and Balzac bows his head and apologizes again as the dark magic Tower and the demon king of incarceration are trying to appease their displeasure with a final bow he wishes them farewell but before leaving he looks at Eugene and smiles gilard does n't know what to make of this situation and politely asks Eugene to leave the room who does so instantly he apologizes to roarian for committing such a grave mistake against him and notes that all of this happened because of his negligence roarian says that 's not the case as it 's his fault he was too rash with iode Gillard notes that iode will be sent back to the main Family Residence and theon 's face drops she tries to plead with him there 's no real reason he needs to be sent back as he has n't even touched black magic right since this is the first time he 's made this mistake she 's sure he wo n't do it again so could n't they just let him stay here Gillard notes that in the entire 300-year history of the lion Hearts not once has the main family produced any dark Mages he will not change his decision as even if iote is his son he has tainted the family name so we can no longer allow him to stay here in a wroth theist notes that there 's nothing for iodi back at the Family Residence seal and cayenne are there and while IOD was here they were both acknowledged by the main family members there 's no place for IOD back there he must stay in aroth no matter what it takes she says that he has done absolutely nothing for iote and only worshiped that bastard of a woman an ailla her children and the adopted brat Gillard asks if that 's really what she truly thinks as he gave all of the children whatever they wished for without discrimination he also sent iode here because he wanted to learn magic theena slams the table and says that if he really cared about iode he would have done anything to make him a roarian pupil if he was that worried he might stray away he should have sent someone to monitor him Gillard with heavy breath and a show of weakness demands she stop stop humiliating the lionhart family more than she already has theonas however does n't stop as she finds her attitude quite righteous and if he truly wishes for iode to be sent somewhere else she will take him back to her parents ' place she wo n't allow him to stay at the main Family Residence and he will learn magic at his parents ' place without being suppressed Gillard notes that if that 's what she and iode want then they can do as they please while walking away Eugene is confronted by Balzac who wishes to speak with him for just a moment they were n't able to have a real conversation because of the incident and would like to speak with him Eugene says that he does n't want to have a conversation with someone such as him and bzac notices that he does n't quite like him is that right Eugene notes that this hatred is n't just for him but rather for all dark Mages and their Magics Balzac says that he understands as it 's been 300 years since the peace packed but people 's attitudes towards it are n't that great it 's quite upsetting given he 's also a dark Mage and it 's a bit embarrassing for him to say this but he has n't done anything bad so he can hate dark magic but why hate him Eugene just looks at him and is n't even thinking of accepting the handshake so Balzac gives up and notes that he heard about him and his achievements during the succession ritual and recently he has also done great with magic which warranted his receiving a recommendation for acrion he could n't tell him what he 's about to say in there but with the responsibilities he agreed to Bear there 's something that might benefit him Eugene demands to know what he was talking about and bzac says that it 's hard to get into acon even with a recommendation letter from anyone as other magic Tower Masters and Maes will reject it should they find him unqualified so as a show of good faith he will also write him a letter of recommendation Eugene wants to know why he would go to this extent and ballzack notes he 's just interested in his talents and does n't hold a great relationship with the red magic Tower Master roarian he holds no ill will towards him but he hates him just because he 's a dark Mage if he were to support his already existing recommendation as the dark magic Tower Master at the very least he would n't hate him as much right and this will also improve his reputation with the lionheart family Eugene notes that if he ever writes it he will graciously take it but he should n't expect to be friendlier with him Balzac says that if he does n't hate him anymore than he hates him now that 's plenty enough for him that is all he had to say so he turns his back away to leave Eugene asks him one final question did he really have no involvement with his brother 's situation Balzac stops and explains that he 's a proud dark Mage and unskilled dark Mages shame dark magic as a whole with their puny existences even if that person was the lion heartt direct successor he would n't have given them any opportunity unless they showed incredible Talent he hopes that reply was satisfactory enough Eugene thinks of iode and how downright pathetic he has become throughout the years he sits in his room and looks at the Unicorn heart Gard gave it to him as a reward for stopping iode from doing something so shameful but how should he use it there are many ways but taking the Mana directly is the easiest and most convenient method he notices that its condition is quite good and despite it being the heart of a beast it has few impurities he begins absorbing the Mana and thinks that at the rate he 's going now he will be a four before he even reaches 20 the lionhart family would be shocked as in their 300-year history nobody has reached four stars in becoming an adult Keon and Gillard are both six stars which already qualifies a person as one of the strongest people in the entire nation he will learn this so he might as well try to become a five-star he will put hamls every experience into the White Flame method vermouth himself created later he meets with gargas who notes that the Giants gems were 30 million cells Eugene finds this quite shocking but gargas pushes him to the bank as if they do n't give the money by midnight the item will be sold to the next bidder at the public Bank the receptionist notices the extremely rare Black Card Eugene gave him so he asks if he would n't like to create an account with this bank as well Eugene swiftly denies it and leaves gargas notes that they should go back as the item will be delivered to where he 's staying once the money is deposited so this is naturally the only chance for him to see a Giant 's gem so close Eugene wonders who is insane enough to want something like that but he has nothing else\",\n",
       " \"to do so they should get going gargas thinks that this means he 's interested and offers some of the essence to him Eugene came along not because of the item but rather because he 's interested in the red flame method gargas learned he will see for himself how different it is from the White Flame method that 's when he spots something and his expression widens he immediately jumps for it and in a moment of desperation he tries to reach something there 's no way that was just a vision as he knows he saw that pointy hat and purple hair just now he stops in the middle of the street where senya seems to be standing alone could this really be her Eugene wonders what to say as she looks the same as she did 300 years ago but he 's completely different so will she really recognize him if he tells her he 's is actually Hamill reincarnated as one of vermouths descendants she wo n't believe it one bit he tries to grab her hand but it goes through her as this is only a hallucination made from Magic she turns around causing him to blush she says only two words found you before disappearing entirely Eugene thinks of her words and smiles he found her as well the real senya mdan he Ponders on a bridge and thinks that senya is certainly alive if she came to find him like this but how could she have known it was him did she see his soul like Tempest did or was it perhaps because of this necklace if she truly knows about the reincarnation sending a hallucination means that she 's in a position that does n't allow her to be here physically the only thing that could force her to do that would be sealing but did she do it herself or someone else perhaps it could be even the Demon King but either way she ca n't come next to him so he gets it she found him first first but now he will have to find her in return gargas comes next to him and asks why he ran in such a hurry Eugene notes that it 's nothing for him to worry about and they should get going already he tells him about his wishes to see the red flame method as he has learned the White Flame method a much more potent and interesting method Eugene notes that he 's just curious about it gargas says that it 's not that difficult to show and rips his shirt off with his ripped body Eugene asks if that really is necessary and gargas notes that it is n't but it does help his mental quite a bit he starts doing it and Eugene asks if the core splits with this method gargas explains that if one were to use the original red flame method the core would n't split but his family has succeeded in increasing the stars of the red flame method to five thanks to the countless efforts of his ancestors of course as far as he knows there are only a few Branch families who attained five starts using the flame method taught to the branch families he has also attained two starts recently Eugene thinks that the flame method gargas and his family use can only go up to five even though it 's one of the top Branch families even after hundreds of years of development the red flame is still limited to five stars the White Flame method is reserved only for the main family while the red flame is given to other families that 's why there is such a gigantic gap between the main and Branch families which will most likely never be closed but he does n't really get it as vermouth was n't the type to be Petty about things like this he was going to try and learn the red flame method if it showed potential but now there 's no need Eugene excuses himself and gargas asks if he wo n't stay to see the Giants gems which Eugene politely refuses to in his research room at the red magic Tower he thinks that senya 's final magic texts are in acon more specifically witchcraft both roarian and the dark magic Tower Master said they would write recommendations so he can only be optimistic about entering acon senya has waited 300 years after all so a little more wo n't hurt right he looks at the Moonlight sword fragment and thinks that if Mana contacts it the whole structure of Mana breaks and disperses however with this fragment he could n't hope of dispersing high class magic but everything else is game so he should have at it if his Mana does n't break from that fragment it means that his mana 's Unity will become much stronger than the White Flame method limits a trainee comes and tells Hera that countless explosions and vibrations have been heard from Eugene 's training room for a few days now she says that she will go to him as she needs to do something for the tower Master anyway Hera arrives at his door and knocks but that 's when the whole room shakes she rushes in but she finds out Eugene is safe and sound also shirtless she asks what he 's been doing and he explains that he 's only training Mana along with his magic training Hera finds it strange that he 's training magic as there is no magic circle inside and what about that fragment as the door is broken and the walls are en cracked but it stands firm Eugene shows her how he 's been training and summons a fireball alongside a few magic missiles he shoots them at the fragment which disperses them throughout the room Hera is quite shocked as he 's using his core like a circle almost perfectly at that his Mana Unity has also become very strong with his magic abilities being even more potent she asks if he 's practicing Warfare magic and you Eugene explains that he 's actually focusing on training the Mana itself and he 's made some progress he thinks that when he started his Mana would dispers before it even burst but now he can force the Mana to stay together in order to create an explosion Hara says that it 's great he 's training so diligently and she came because someone told her there were explosions in the research room so she came to check his condition Eugene asks if she really came only because of that and she says no as the tower Master wants to see him Eugene picks up his clothes and asks if he 's on the top floor as he will go to meet him right away Hera tells him that he is n't there but actually inside of the Royal Library acrion in aro 's capital Pentagon the center is shaped was created by the Five magic Tower Masters that 's also where aro 's Castle Abram sits it is built in the middle of a big lake so it can not be reached without a boat as Magics have no effect in this place this is because of the demon ceiling Circle that surround rounds the area which was gifted by seya to the royal family as a token of friendship and it stands even now hundreds of years later Eugene thinks that this is plain crazy as he has come to understand a bit of magic since he came to aroth but it feels downright impossible to create such a gigantic Circle Hera asks if he would like to visit Abram and he notes that he was just looking because it looks nice as it 's not a place one would visit only because they wanted to she notes that his words are correct as only the magic Tower Masters and high nobility are allowed inside even the tower Masters ca n't use magic in there and the only ones who can would be the royal family and the castle Mages who have sworn absolute loyalty to them Eugene asks if the tower Masters also did n't swear loyalty to the to the royal family and Hera says they have but they do n't obey unreasonable orders so the magic towers and aoth have a mutual cooperation agreement it 's not the castle that holds a deep relationship with the magic Towers but rather the Parliament the castle has its own group of Mages so the tower Mages are typically for the parliament but he should n't take this as the Mages having something against each other or something as they do not they arrive at Aron 's doors and Hera notes that three people disagreed with letting him inside the blue\",\n",
       " \"Tower Master the green and the Mage Guild Tower Master if he can somehow gain their recognition he will be able to enter into acrion easily she also notes that this is as far as she can go but she still wishes him luck and urges him to not be nervous Eugene thanks her for the kind words and shortly after he presents himself to everyone the captain of the castle Mages trle wizor roarian gener Osman the green magic Tower Master Huth usen the Blue Magic Tower Master melketh elhaya the White Tower Master Balzac and the magic Guild Master Edgard gyen Honan Abram the first successor of aroth tells him to raise his head and and notes that he heard his name quite a lot these past few days and always wanted to meet him Eugene looks at him and thinks that he 's heard about him that he is the first successor and a genius that reached five stars before reaching adulthood the blue Tower Master notes that he 's heard plenty about him but the dark magic and red magic Tower Master have also been advocating for him quite aggressively at that he is quite aware that he 's talented but magic and swordsmanship and Magic are entirely different things he thinks that this kid is only and has only gotten into magic so how does someone like that receive an acon recommendation there is something behind this surely roarian is an old friend of lionhearts patriarch and the dark magic Tower Master wants to get closer to the lion Hearts as to cover the recent incident that must be it Eugene says that he understands but what needs to be done to make them let him inside roarian says that he only needs to show him magic as the Nobles and wise Mages in this room will analyze him the blue Tower Master notes that originally he would have to show them extensive research and things like this but he presumes he does n't hold anything of that nature right Eugene looks at them and notes that he 's starting he spins his stars and forms a circle and they all assess him the magic Guild Master thinks that he 's only been training his Mana for 4 years so he 's definitely talented if anything the green Tower Master thinks that this is n't enough as there 's a huge difference between Mona management and Magic standing Eugene summons a few spells and changes between them perfectly and seamlessly trle watches closely and notes that for one to do what that child just did they must have perfect understanding of Magic the green Tower Master asks if he can use magic while also using the sword Aura and Eugene Smiles he pulls out wined and maintains both perfectly the blue Tower Master notes that his circle is still intact and even though he is using his core as a circle it functions still as a core should quite amazing for such a young lad roarian asks them what they think about him and the green Tower Master notes that they will have to discuss it thoroughly roarian agrees and asks Eugene to go outside for a little with that he leaves and the blue Tower Master immediately starts interrogating roarian did he really not guide this child in any way roarian notes that he has told them multiple times already he did not guide Eugene one bit and that child has only read the red Tower 's introductory texts to study Magic by himself the blue Tower Master wonders if it 's really possible for one to read only introductory texts and Achieve that level of understanding Edgard notes that he 's a lionard of the Keel Empire and also a descendant of the great vermouth it is know how great his blood still is throughout the continent right but what did they think as he could sense that Eugene was a genius from the start melketh adds that Eugene showed the magic fit for a first Circle but its power far exceeds that they probably all felt it right the purity of his Mana the preciseness of its Arrangement and most of all the unity of his Mana they will have to check of course but she does n't think even a fourth circle would be able to deactivate his magic the magic Guild Master says that still he 's too young he might be a genius but they should n't hurry as he 's still growing also considering aon 's Prestige having roarian teach him for a few good years until he 's fit for acon would n't be that bad of an idea trle says it 's best if they think of this as an investment he 's 17 talented and a lion heart to boot he 's quite young and his skills are n't mastered yet so he holds Limitless potential that much is undeniable they are already on friendly terms with his family but they can also do Eugene a favor as an individual and invest in him and his future the green Tower Master notes that even if he is this talented he 's still an adopted son of the family so he wo n't become patriarch no matter what bzac says that one of the twins specifically Cayenne will become patriarch technically iot is the rightful successor but considering his recent shameful activity and his inferiority he wo n't be able to contest the patriarch position at all so even thought he ca n't become the patriarch Eugene 's foothold in the family should n't be scoffed at trample agrees and Eugene will have to leave the main family at some point if he gets married and has children it 's the lionheart custom to move out of the main residence they should invite him to aroth when that happens as he will surely be skilled enough and if they do this favor for him he will become a Dependable Ally Balzac says that Eugene also showed how skilled he was in the succession ritual that took place four years ago even the lionhart family recognized his potential and with the added support of a rooth he might actually be the second coming of the great vermouth the green Tower Master laughs and notes that he 's praising them quite a lot but can he say that his statements are his and his alone ballzack asks what he could mean and the green Tower Master notes that he has a contract with the demon king of incarceration so he 's a tad curious if he holds any influence over his words Balzac notes that the demon king is a busy person and besides if he were speaking for him he would have behaved quite differently and would he more determined to use his power the blue Tower Master asks if that 's really his power and the room becomes filled with deadly killing intent but Balzac apologizes for sounding aggressive as he simply that he 's very devoted to The Demon King and his wishes MTH says that they should n't stray away from the topic and it does n't seem that they will be reaching an agreement soon so why do n't they put it to a vote as that kid is probably bored by now Edgard notes that is probably for the best and he will go first he agrees with letting Eugene inside of acrion this Royal Library does n't only hold magic texts of varying worths but also texts left behind by many legendary Mages who are a considerable foothold into the history of magic on each of its floors Eugene notices that the walls are crammed with ao 's history and it 's more like a museum than a library this place has 15 stories and out of those senya 's texts should be on Floors 12 to 15 MTH comes next to him and he thinks that she 's the best spiritualist of this time period and the person who signed two simultaneous contracts with the two spirit Kings for the first time in history even without the spiritual magic she 's still considered very great at normal Magic Eugene asks if they are done debating and she notes that it is indeed over as if they had to reach a unanimous agreement this would have taken days so they voted five people have agreed to allow him entry and two did not with one being neutral Eugene notes that the majority agreed so we can go to the upper floors now right melketh says that he can but does n't he want to know who agreed and who did n't Eugene notes that he 's not really interested as all that matter is that the majority agreed MTH says that he 's quite boring and tells him that she was\",\n",
       " \"the one that was neutral that does n't mean that she disagrees with his entry but she did n't want to be swept up in the argument he sees their faces now right they look very pissed off and it 's true that they decided on votes but they are going to be having another argument very soon the blue Tower Master looks at them and shakes his head she notes that even though he 's acting like this he was one of the ones who agreed which is quite unexpected as he was very aggressive at first was n't he but now does he want to know who disagreed Eugene notes that he does n't really care as he told her before she still tells him the green Tower master and the Mage Guild Master were the ones who disagreed Eugene still does n't still care which causes MTH to be quite annoyed with him as his reactions are too boring does n't he want to be mad that they dared to reject a lion heart or something like that Eugene says no and walks away she stops him and says that the sword on his hip is wined which is blessed by the kind of wind Spirits right Eugene confirms it and melketh notes that she always wanted to form a contract with him but he wo n't come to her no matter how much she begs she tried really hard and even called upon the king of Thunder spirits and the king of Earth Spirits as well but the king of wind Spirits wo n't even think of signing a contract with her she even sent a letter to the lionhart residents but apparently they are too pompous to lend Family Treasures she was treated like a thief but the only thing she wants to do is sign a contract Eugene says that he ca n't lend her the sword not matter what she tells him as technically it 's not his and he 's just borrowing it with the patriarch 's permission MTH says that it 's fine as she wo n't tell anyone and she only needs to lend it to him for just a bit it wo n't take long and he can watch if he wants Eugene thinks that the king of wind Spirits Tempest is quite the annoying bastard as he has tried to summon him again this past four years with no luck it 's probably because he does n't have enough Mana now but if it 's her the only spiritualist who signed a contract with two spirit Kings at once it might be possible however there 's no need for him to accept her offer no matter how good it is as if he lets her desperation build over time she will be willing to give more he asks where he can get his entry card and she guides him he eventually gets one and thinks that it 's quite simple and ID with his seal melketh notes that the familiar spirits in here were left by the great Mages who left their marks on acon throughout its history the Mage King who established aoth the battle mage who was called the father of battle magic and senya all of their familiar spirits are in here Eugene says nothing and she notes that his reaction is quite boring as she thought he was very interested in SAA did n't he look for her floors earlier she also knows that on the first day he arrived here he toured her mansion and last time he met a friend from an indirect Branch at mdan Square Eugene asks how she knows so much and MTH says that he 's probably not aware but he 's very famous around these parts Eugene notes that he 's sure he is and MTH say that being kind of a bastard so is he going to lend her wied now he declines she guides him to the elevator and teaches him how to use it she notes that if he 's going to the 12th floor he must really like SAA Eugene says that he in fact does not but she 's not going to wait here for him right MTH says that she does n't have that much time to spare as she wanted to come with but then he might be embarrassed the shock he will receive when he discovers part of the truth will leave a lasting impression on him maybe he should take a diaper with him as he might have an accident Eugene has had enough of this strange woman and smashes the elevator button the elevator slowly makes its way to the 12th floor where what seems to be a small sea welcomes him to Sea 's Hall Eugene is quite puzzled to say the least Eugene asks if this really is seya he 's speaking with but she denies this as she 's her familiar Spirit tasked with managing her Hall Eugene remembers that MTH said that acon holds senya 's familiar spirit inside so this must be her he also asks how she knows his name as he has n't told her yet she explains that c registered his name into acrion and not just her but all familiar spirits are connected to acrion and its magical system Eugene asks what she would like to be called and she says that SAA used to call her mayor Eugene asks if that is n't the mayor from her surname mdan M says that he 's right and that 's it 's a nice and honorable name Eugene thinks that making a familiar spirit that looks just like her and also giving it part of her name is quite weird what is she planning Eugene notes that he does n't know much about this place but our familiar spirits usually like her humanlike he means May explains that the other familiar spirits do n't look like her but she 's quite special as her Creator the wise senya made her with her personality at the base Eugene remembers that roarian said that making a living thing is forbidden and asks May if that is n't the case with her she says Technically she 's not alive as she does n't have a soul like other beings and her body was made from senya 's Magic with her real body being that giant ball Eugene asks what that is and she gets ready to explain diligently before her hat falls of so she embarrassingly crouches to Pi it up this thing is the essence of magic that sea the wise dedicated her whole life for witchcraft Eugene thinks that the magic texts are split into three parts High intermediate and low and they were finished right before she retired but just how is that a book May notes that books do n't need to look like books as that is just a common Prejudice Eugene finds her words quite annoying and confusing but she finds it only natural that he does n't understand as even the magic Tower Masters failed to comprehend Sea 's magic Eugene stares at her and thinks that she 's fully of Pride accompanied with a sneer on her face and that condescending attitude she really took perfectly after Sea 's personality Eugene asks if sea was like this until the very end and Mar explains that she changed quite a bit as this personality of hers is based on Sea 's younger years she became much more elegant and refined however she also did n't smile much and only focused on researching and developing magic Eugene finds that to be quite unbelievable but he lets it Go and asks if her Consciousness really is in there inside of Witchcraft May notes that her Consciousness is entirely made from the spells in Witchcraft and her purpose is to protect and manage it she 's been managing this hall for well over 200 years under senya 's direct orders Eugene approaches Witchcraft and thinks to what roarian told him that his magic felt like that of a child 's after he read it it is true that it 's outside the scope of known and common magic Eugene asks if she would n't happen to know where seya retired to but she confirms that she indeed does n't as her retirement was so discreet her students Mansion servants and even she do n't know a thing about her whereabouts even then the king of a rooth and multiple magic Tower Masters and mages interrogated her extensively about senya but even when she told them she did n't know a thing they refused to believe her those useless bastards started to get into witchcraft to try and go through her memories but their skills must be quite lacking as once every few decades they come to check again\",\n",
       " \"like something would change Eugene thinks that looking through her memories is n't just to find Sea 's location as however much the Mages venerated and respected seya with such a material in front of them perfect for experimenting any Mage would dissect it to find out what makes it tick Eugene says that he heard the only public witchcraft in acrion is the high one so are the other two here as well may explains that this one 's definitely the original however senya extracted the intermediated and low ones from that original and donated it with only the high part left over to acrion May finds his curiosity about senya quite interesting and Eugene asks why he would n't be May notes that while this is true he 's not even a traditional Mage as he 's from the lionart family so this is her first time seeing one of vermouth descendants and he has her quite intrigued from what she knows seya after returning to a Roth did n't meet with the lionhart family a single time not with vermouth either Eugene thinks that according to lionheart 's written records vermouth did n't meet with his old friends ever again after returning from helmet senya anise and [ __ ] met up again just once because of vermouths death even if vermouth was n't really the sociable type the fact that they did n't meet at all after leaving helmod and establishing the lionart family is quite weird to say the least he asks May if seya ever spoke about her companions and she explains that she called [ __ ] a dumbass and anise a snake Eugene sheepishly asks what she said about haml and may starts numbering off a bunch of very hard swears which Eugene finds as quite inelegant for such a refined lady May notes that an elegant lady can still swear from time to time but whenever seya spoke of her companions she looked like she was going to cry especially when she talked about Hamill that made her suffer the most Eugene asks what she said when she talked about vermouth and Mer notes that when she did talk about him she did n't praise judge or insult him in the slightest Eugene stares at a portrait of SAA and thinks that it 's the same one as in the Mansion May notes that the smile in this portrait is fake as she never once smiled like that not a single time when she had conversations with her to replicate her personality she asked about it once about why she 's faking the smile in her portrait when she 's quite sad seya explained that it 's better to leave behind a smiling face rather than sad face when people are going to see it for Generations M says that she ca n't leave acrion and she never has so she has n't seen it herself but she knows a similar portrait stands in saa 's mansion in this particular portrait the smile was painted by the artist without her asking for it which she did n't really like but what she said was true it 's better to leave a smiling face behind Eugene feels sorry for her and tries to Pat her on the head but she slaps his hand away and notes that he should n't cross the line as she 's been alive for 200 years so she does n't want to be treated like a child Mar continues to guide him through senya 's Hall and shows him the magic equipment she used and her favorite staff ACAA Eugene recognizes it instantly and myr notes that she knew he would recognize it there 's a fairy tree said to only grow in the great Samar Forest the homeland of the elves ACAA is the world 's most powerful known magic staff made from the roots of the thousand-year-old tree in the center of the elf Forest the elves strongly believe that the tree holds the spirits of their predecessors and that it 's holding up the whole world does he really understand that those might elves cut one of the trees roots to make seya a gift Eugene thinks that senya is human through and through but she was involved with elves quite a bit seya did n't know who her parents were as she was abandoned in the Samar Forest a great jungle in the southern region of the continent an elf who just happened to be passing by heard her cry died and raised seya that is how she came to grow up in the elves Dominion at first they were n't that fond of her but when they realized she possessed great talent they recognized her as one of their own and taught her Elven magic may explains that senya is the only person to own a staff made from the trees Roots but that 's not all as the Red Jewel at the end of the staff is a dragon heart as far as they know there are only two magic staves in the world that used a dragon heart as an ingredient senya staff ACAA and Eugene finished her sentence Blood Mary the person who is currently holding Blood Mary is one of the three dark Mages singed with the demon king of incarceration count Edmund cadth of helmed 300 years ago the staff 's owner was a lich by the name of beel a direct subordinate of the demon king and the one who killed him the demon king of incarceration was extremely difficult to fight compared to the other demon Kings and all the demons there were so strong they could be compared to the demon Kings themselves but three of them were especially strong the dagger shield and staff of incarceration when he defeated the shield of incarceration he sustained a mortal injury and by the time the fight with beel was over he found himself with a large hole in his chest he asks if he can hold the staff and may allows him but also notes that he wo n't be able to cast magic with it as AAA only recognizes senya as its owner Eugene picks it up and tries to power his Mana into it but the staff denies it outright he thought that just maybe he 'd be recognized by AAA due to senya 's Apparition that Sly woman should have left him this staff instead of some necklace May notes that he really must like seya and he says that liking her is not what he would call this may notes that he 's lying as his eyes shine whenever he speaks about her and he 's very focused when looking at her things Eugene explains that he just likes old stories and the artifacts that come with them may says that if he like that he will certainly like this book she walks towards the library and pulls out a book and gives it to him Warrior vermouths Great Adventures she explains that this picture book is the first one to tell the world about vermouth and his Legend Eugene notes that he does n't like that book one bit as he likes Hamill the best and respects him the most but in this book he 's made to seem like he was just luggage for the party a useless member May notes that this book is the original version and it 's different than the versions out today as it was published 300 years ago though nobody knows who the author really is Eugene takes the book but it 's even worse than in the recent ones as it tells of him as an idiot who challenged vermouth countless times but face planted every time Eugene thinks that he did in fact faceplant a couple of times but he did manage to touch him more than once is this book written by that snake anise May says that if he likes ham so much he might like what she will show him next quite a bit they walk throughout the hall and arve at what seem to be Holograms of the party which surprises Eugene quite a bit May explains that these are memories that seya extracted and left here personally they are not like the portraits but real memories of Sea 's colleagues the handsome man standing in the middle is the great vermouth next to him the woman who 's smiling so much one ca n't see her eyes is Anise the faithful the one who would rather be considered a troll than a human is more on the Brave and the one who looks like a real Troublemaker is Hamill the foolish even though this is common not a single memory of Hamill 's life was left behind and one can only see Hamill 's appearance in\",\n",
       " \"this very Hall Eugene notes that he 's quite dashing Hamill that is May asks if there 's something wrong with his head and Eugene explains that Hamill has the charm of a wild beast a comment which makes him die inside a bit and may to be left speechless they sit at a table while Eugene is reading a book and he says that the traces of senya that have been preserved are on Floors 12 to 14 so what 's on the top floor May explains that the 13th floor contains research and Memoirs of senya 's plans when she was creating acrion something that he wo n't be able to understand right now the 14th floor also has magic books that contain extensive research and they would also be quite difficult to understand but since they all have explanations they would be a much better choice than the research notes Eugene asks if these would be better than reading Witchcraft and she notes that it 's quite hard to put into words so it would be much better if he had a go at reading it himself they arrive at Witchcraft and she explains that it 's a method of optimizing Mana from a circle and with that his magic power will be Amplified a simplification of the technique for maximum effect is omission of chanting basically materializing magic through a separation of Consciousness as when unconscious magic that enters the body is stored and can be manifested differently depending on the given situation the most wonderful thing about all of this is the perfect Drive of circle although most Mages Circle these days the method of circle magic in witchcraft is far superior than a normal Circle so it will be easier for him to just think of it as using the maximum amount of Mana to create the strongest power possible Eugene much like myself did n't understand a word of what she just said but she expected this as if he understood just from listening witchcraft would n't be the greatest book ever right Eugene asks what he can do to read this hyped up book and she notes that he should close his eyes and open his hand then inject his Mana into Witchcraft and he will be able to read it Eugene does so but is confused does he have to pour Mana into it or apply Mana to the circle like when he uses magic suddenly he feels that his mind has been transported elsewhere he feels like he 's in a dream but also different than that he 's stuck almost as if he were experiencing sleep paralysis but without the hallucinations he just feels entirely powerless a sea of Mana rushes in and makes a giant Circle below him which also creates more circles until the big circle is filled with numerous smaller circles he wakes up from this pseudo dream and asks May if he did anything strange while he was out she notes that fainting instantly can be considered strange but he should n't worry as many Mages literally soil themselves after entering witchcraft but he just foamed at the mouth a bit and fainted which lasted for 2 hours the white magic Tower master melketh and the blue magic Tower Master Huth both soiled themselves pretty hard The First Time Eugene remembers what MTH told him about having an accident so it seems she was speaking from experience myrrh asks how his first experience was and he notes that it was difficult and quite hard to understand as he still does n't quite get it or rather he gets it vaguely but ca n't make up the rest with knowledge or theories seeing the drive of Circle was also quite interesting as inside of an enormous Circle countless circles were being created in a second and he only got up to Nine Circles mayor notes that as he said when seya first created the circle method of magic she only held Nine Circles but she still continue magic research nonetheless therefore she managed to cross the limit she set on herself the Eternal hole an eventuality of circle magic that only senya was able to reach and only her after witchcraft many Mages made it their goal goal to also reach the Eternal hole but none could break past the Ninth Circle no matter how much they tried if one can use Mana without wasting a drop of it and control all the Mana inside of that gigantic Circle the circle will divide and rotate that in it of itself is the perfect Drive of circle even though it 's though to create the Eternal hole it 's quite easy to use if for Magic a fireball for example if use from the Eternal hole is much more powerful than the Ninth Circle Hellfire an additional one does not waste any manage and the techniques are n't complicated either does he get it now how unrivaled sea was after creating the Eternal hole although now there 's no way to really check she could have certainly been able to kill the demon Kings Eugene thinks that after returning from helmwood senya did n't just relax and got much stronger than he ever remembers the same goes for the other party members but why did n't they try to fight The Demon King what was vermouth thinking later he gets out of the hall where roarian and malakith are waiting for him roarian asks how his first experience with witchcraft was and Eugene notes that he is n't quite sure as with the knowledge he has right now it would take years to understand just a single book malakith says that it 's only natural as the texts are the sense of aro 's magic and even if he 's very smart there 's a limit to what he can learn without a proper teacher so that 's just if he could lend winned to her for just a little while he will help him understand the texts is n't that a great deal Eugene notes that there 's no need for it to be magic texts so does she has something else to offer an item perhaps malakith says that he knows how to negotiate and offers him a staff as he does n't have one of those yet and it 's great for controlling Mana Eugene is n't that intrigued and roarian says that he has plenty of staves and can lend him one whenever he likes malakith asks why he 's interfering in their trade and he says that she already has contracts with two of the spirit Kings so why is she so greedy she asked asked if it 's because he thinks that if she 's going to make a contract with the king of wind Spirits she will make a mess and he confirms that this is exactly what he thinks malakith says that they have been friends for decades and should know that she does n't want to have anything to do with aro 's inner Politics as she finds them quite annoying roarian notes that she 's saying this now but who know how she will be once she holds great power she explains that indeed he knows what he means but she does n't intend to change because of power even if she does manage to sign a contract with the wind Spirits King roarian says she swore on her Mana so he will trust her as she did it on her own Eugene says that he thought about it but he really does n't want to staff from her malakith says that she did n't want to give one to him but rather lend it Eugene explains that he will only be giving her Winn it for a few days should they come to a deal and if the price is to lend an artifacts of hers for a few days he would rather not agree to a deal malakith finds is bargaining quite annoying and notes that she will give him an artifact for one year for every day she keeps wined Eugene says that 's 7 years for a week so she must be quite desperate to make a contract with the king of winds Spirits she notes that she is as to her and other spiritualists the king of winds Spirits is like a dream because the great vermouth signed a contract with him roarian notes that malakith also has a very precious and great artifact which intrigues him quite a bit roarian says that it 's something called called the Cape of darkness and malakith demands he stop talking he asks why she 's so mad as from what he heard he has n't touched the thing for 10 years so is n't it better to lend it to someone and get what\",\n",
       " \"she wants instead of keeping it as decoration and gathers dust Eugene asks what the Cape of darkness is and she tries to dodge the question but roarian explains that it contains the highest level of SpaceTime magic it 's similar in function to the shield of gadon in the lionheart treasury as it directs attacks into the cape and makes them flow in another Direction entirely malakith notes that it is n't that great as one ca n't deflect an attack unless they perfectly calculate the spatial coordinates and guide the attack with their Mana roarian says that in addition the exterior of the Cape is Enchanted with Advanced defense magic so just simply wearing it would protect him from fifth Circle attack magic furthermore there is also a Subspace in the cape where he can store his weapons and use them when needed malakith is extremely angry with him and Eugene notes that he would like this cape of Darkness instead of a staff but not right now as he will have to ask the patriarch malakith says that she has n't agreed to anything yet and Eugene says that it 's too bed but he used his brain quite a bit and is quite hungry might roarian like to get some grub together roarian accepts the offer and notes that there 's a great place in the sky wealthy are with a stunning view they talk like old friends and malakith agrees Eugene wonders why she 's still here and she notes that if he really wants the Cape of Darkness he can have it Eugene notes that there 's no need to hurry like this as he needs to ask the patriarch first and foremost this causes her to reach a Breaking Point and they are both rightly horrified of her reaction Gillard was n't opposed to him lending wined but said that a lionart supervisor would need to be present for melketh to borrow wined they all wait for said supervisor and Eugene asks if what she 's wearing is the Cape of Darkness she says that it 's really cool and Eugene notes that it would look cooler on him she gets quite mad at this sentence but Eugene urges her to calm down malakith asks who this supervisor is and Eugene explains that it 's Kion the patriarch 's youngest brother and the lionheart Guardian he came personally because it 's the first time they lent a treasure and to also deal with iod 's problem malakith notes that if he 's a guardian he 's a Hound for the lion Hearts is n't that so Eugene thinks that the Guardians of the family are named the lion hearts black lions they have many names but what malakith described them as is n't too different from what they as they obey the lionart law more than anything else a year ago Keon joined the order but it was n't a great deal as if one is skilled and can prove their loyalty they can apply to the order the lionhart main family white lion order serves only the main family while the black lion order obeys any Lion Heart and behind this order is the Senate who regardless of branch have etched their names into the history of the lion hearts even Gillard as the patriarch is n't on the same level as those Geyers he never once saw them when he was at the main Family Residence so he wonders how strong they are a black Carriage arrives where a few order members sit the group wait for the black lions to get out of their carriage and malakith finds this entrance of theirs quite pretentious Eugene thought that she liked and respected vermouth but she urges him to not misunderstand she respects him but the lionard family not so much she does n't like that the main family suppresses the branch families and also the sneaky and mysterious Senate which guide these black lion dogs raran says that she should n't show her distaste towards them as if she really wants win it in her hands she should avoid displeasing them in any way malakith notes that she will not be doing as they please as the deal she 's giving them is quite Fair as her precious Cape of Darkness will be far away from home for a while the carriage lands and the first person to get out is Seal Eugene is surprised to see her here and asks what she might be doing in a place such as this she notes that her mother 's birthday will be here soon so she is here to buy her a gift additionally she wanted to see how he was doing Eugene does n't reacts as she wanted to this making her look at him in a strange way she is quite disappointed and that 's when Keon gets out of the carriage and happily greets him an elderly man comes from behind him and notes that it was n't even that long since since he last saw him there 's plenty of time for pleasantries so they should get to the business at hand Eugene notes that this man looks very skilled and judging by his posture and muscle structure he is a spear user the one in the back is a mage it makes complete sense for one to be here since this is about winned as well as iod 's issue and behind all of them stands a woman who seems to be the leader Eugene analyzes her and thinks that she does n't use any conventional Weaponry but rather her hands judging by her outfit she seems to be the highest position here first she greets roarian as they are old acquaintances and she 's surprised he is the tower Master now he explains that he told her the last time they met that he was going to be the red magic Tower Master she ca n't seem to recall this event as it 's been too long but she does n't really care that much either she looks at Eugene and introduces herself as Carmen lionhart she is a grandon to him but he should n't call her that Eugene is quite surprised by this this woman is gillard 's Aunt considering roarian and malakith he 's not that surprised that she looks so young but why did someone of her status come all the way here roarian notes that the weather is quite cold so they should talk inside they all sit at a table and get ready to make the deal Carmen is the youngest sister of the previous patriarch she did n't get married and stayed at the main family 's residence then entered the black lion order where she 's the Third Captain Nathan is the third legion 's vice captain and from a branch family palago is just a mage also from the third Legion he is from a rare Magic Branch family and in charge of the deal with malakith he says that the lionart main family heirloom wined will be given in exchange for the Cape of Darkness artifact the deal is that for every year she keeps on to wined Eugene gets to keep the cape for a year is that it malakith confirms it and palago presents them with the contract he has prepared malakith takes her time reading it and reads that in case Winn it is somehow destroyed she will play the corresponding fees what is that supposed to mean Carmen who was sitting at the window says that her life would be the correct price winned is a treasure that nobody can put monetary value on so if she wants to borrow it she will also be risking her life in a way malakith notes that her life is also something that ca n't be exchanged for money Carmen explains that here in a Roth Perhaps it is so but that does n't matter to the lion Hearts palago says that she does n't need to put her life on the line he respects her greatly as a mage and does n't believe she will make an amateur mistake during the process of forming a contract and break the sword however if the sword if somehow destroyed they will discuss the problem then is n't that fair malakith notes that she does n't like this one bit and Carmen says that if she does n't she should n't accept the deal as they do n't need to lend her winad and are also here because of the patriarch 's orders malakith says that a certain someone might think they are here just for her but their real reason is quite different Carmen says she 's right as she has a more important issue to attend to rather than this trivial trade she promised Balzac\",\n",
       " \"to meet in an hour to discuss iod 's issue and question the dark Mage who helped him roarian explains that the last time he talked with Gillard he said she would be following a Roth 's laws regarding this but her tone says otherwise Carmen explains that even if the patriarch said that the Senate thinks otherwise as this whole incident has sullied the lionhart name quite a bit so the dark Mage must pay for it one way or another Eugene finds her pocket watch and the size of it quite hilarious and malakith is more forward asking why she has a gigantic pocket watch and why she 's keeping a cigar in her mouth if she 's not smoking it Carmen Dodges the question completely and notes that she already got permission from aro 's king and the Parliament so is n't it better for them to question question him rather than make things unnecessarily difficult Eugene thinks that by permission she means that they paid the parliament a large amount they could n't just ignore to allow the lion Hearts to question the dark Mage and punish him accordingly Carmen asks what she 's going to do with wiid and malakith thinks it will take about 3 hours give or take to form a contract with the king of wind Spirits so it will take at most 2 months to get the cape back with that she signs it both parties walk away with what they wanted and Carmen says that the cape has a nice design and especially likes the fur as it reminds her of the lion heart symbol but the color is too dark as it should have been a pure white or something more gray Eugene looks at her and she stares back seal comes from behind it and notes that he should give it to her as she wants to try it on Eugene looks at her one last time and urges her to try it on as it might look good on her she immediately equips it and poses around like a model until she is satisfied she explains that it could use a lion on the back or something similar malakith joins the conversation notes that she 's only lending it to them so they should n't modify it in any way and ruin it Carmen notes that it 's time to go and Keon calls for seal who notes that she will be waiting for Eugene they walk the streets and Eugene says that she should tell Cen to get rid of the bunny ear dirty Magazine from his bed as nah knows about it and he 's afraid that soon the ma forms will include bunny ears seal says that she will let their mother know about this and Eugene urges her to not do that and instead hint at it somehow like saying that bunny ears are n't that great seal asks what kind of ears he likes and he in turn asks why she 's changing the topic to suddenly seal explains that he said bunny ears are n't it so he must like other types of ears right Eugene says that he likes normal ears but enough with this bickering as they need to go buy a present already by the way why did she make him come along as he does n't know what anaila likes seal says that she does so he only needs to follow her Eugene notes that he does n't need to come with her if all he 's doing is following her she turns around and says that he 's still a jackass is he really going to leave her alone in a place that she has never visited before Eugene says that she is n't a stupid child to get lost and she notes that he says all of this but is coming along anyways right Eugene explains that he has to at this point as he knows she 's going to hold a grudge if he does things she does n't like seal also asks about his birthday as it was a few months ago so what did he do Eugene notes that he did n't know much of anything and read books in the red magic tower all day seal asks about presence and he explains that he did n't get any but roarian and Hera did want to give him some but he begged them not to she asks who Hera is a woman perhaps Eugene asks what kind of man has Hera for a name and notied that she did n't come here only for presence what does she want to do with Carmen seal says that he 's quick to catch on to things and explains that she 's trying to convince her to become her Mentor as Cayenne is going to be the patriarch anyhow and she does n't really want to her mother also seems to want an arranged marriage for her but she does n't really want to do that as she does n't want to be cooped up in the main Family Residence and act like a lady all of the time Eugene says that this means that she wants to join the black lion order but she notes that she ca n't as she wants to be taught by kmen herself Eugene says that it 's good that she 's trying to do something for herself instead of leeching the family 's money but also how is Cen doing these days she explains that he talks about him quite often and always wonders how many stars he has Eugene says that three same as when he left and Cen appears to be the same too a twar Eugene asks about iode as he only heard he went back home seal explains that theonis is looking for a mage to teach him a private tutor of sorts she finds this quite funny as his mother still wants to urge him into becoming a mage but he 's not going to become patriarch anyhow so why not let him live as he wishes but enough with the unpleasantries they should go eat are there any good restaurants he knows about Eugene explains that there are plenty but it wo n't be as good as the food back home she looks at him and notes that the taste does n't matter that much but the atmosphere Nathan finishes torturing the Mage and announces him as dead Carmen notes that he did n't say a word despite all of the torture they gave him so he really did n't know a thing this is quite funny however that a low-ranking dark Mage such as this guy got into direct contact with someone from the lionhart direct line of lineage and also managed to arrange a contract either he did n't know what fear is or he was plain crazy Balzac says that he must have been desperate as he got into dark magic decades ago but did n't accomplish a single thing and did n't have anything to his name if he were to die without accomplishing a single thing his soul Soul would have become the Demon 's possession and he would n't be able to go back into the cycle of life and reincarnate he wanted to try everything he could even if it put him in a tough situation he would be able to get out of it by using the power he earned by selling out iode Carmen heard that the night witch Queen Noir zabella was n't involved in all of this but what does he think Balzac notes that it feels like they are blaming him now but he has cooperated in every way possible and also showed plenty of respect ECT and how sorry he was Carmen explains that it does n't make sense for a mere dark Mage to be behind all of this and he fits the bill much more perfectly ballzack notes that he understands where she 's coming from but what would he earn if that were to be the case and if it really were him behind all of this he would have covered his own tracks much more efficiently and made sure nobody would even think that it would have been him he has many enemies that much everybody knows but his majesty the great demon king of incarceration eration blessed him with endless trust and love which he is eternally grateful for also in Helmut there are many who despise him for being treated so nicely in his honest opinion someone who hates him probably did this to put him in a difficult situation like he is now Carmen notes that he does n't have any proof for that to be the case and ballzack says that there 's also no proof that he had anything to\",\n",
       " \"do with this he does n't know how many times he has to say it was n't him but it 's not just him that was put in a difficult situation because of this is n't that right Carmen says that he is free to talk about anything he wishes but Freedom comes with some responsibility so is he capable of taking that responsibility and facing the consequences of his words bzac explains that as a loyal servant of the great demon king of incarceration he hold the lion Hearts very near and dear to him as the great king himself does that is why he apologized so sincerely and profusely while also cooperating in any way way he can however he is only human and ca n't do anything about how upset he feels because of their baseless accusations he Balzac lbth aro 's dark magic Tower master and servant of the great demon Kink of incarceration understands that they do n't wish to show him an ounce of respect but he will not tolerate endless insults for his own sake and for his majesty the demon king of incarceration Keon immediately puts his hand on his sword and gets ready to attack Carmen knows that she does n't want to create any sort of trouble in a foreign land such as this one Balzac says that if she wishes she can take care of things in such a way that nobody would notice Carmen notes that for nobody to notice his head would need to stay on his shoulders however it is worth considering at least that someone from The Lion Hearts wants to harm the prestige and honor of the main family that is entirely just speculation though as they could n't figure out anything using torture and Magic which seems to neat that that is why she 's suspecting him first and foremost Balzac apologizes for misspeaking but he has told them already countless times in fact that it was n't him as he has not in a single reason to do this for Carmen says that she believes him but what about the incubus who tried to make a contract with iode as it 's not a pleasant sight at all she has seen plenty of disgusting and downright cruel things in her life with one of those things being in front of her right now Balzac notes that if she insists she will receive what she wishes he summons a dark hand that pulls out the head of the incubus bzac explains that the demon king of incarceration took his soul and if they really want she can have this bzac drops it and she kicks it so hard blood splatters on him with that they go back but not without warning Balzac first if he ever contacts Eugene lionhardt there will be hell to pay Balzac notes that the only person who is allowed to control his actions and desires is the demon king of incarceration so even if she 's a li in heart she has absolutely no right to tell him what to do while they walk away Carmen asks Keon what he thinks really happened as she suspects Amelia Merwin as she 's somebody who despises the dark magic Tower Master position and all it entails the demon king of incarceration lets the dark Mages contracted to him to do whatever they wish to so he does n't need to intervene when his underlings quarrel like this either Keon says that if Amelia did all of this would n't Nama be behind it as well Carmen explains that nahama is also quite suspicious and a war will probably break out in a few years the most likely first Target of this war would be tath as nahama has always had issues with it Keel will have to prepare for war once all of this happens and the lion Hearts will also be called forwards for the preparation Keon notes that Amelia probably did all of this with that in mind and Carmen says that it could also just be an isolated incident with no real conspiracy behind it she also asks what would have happened if she did n't overlook bzac clear provocation earlier and Keon says that if they fought him right there and then everyone excluding her would have died Carmen notes that he 's quite humble and he explains that he 's not really fit to fight Mages she notes that she 's the one who 's not confident that is why they have n't fought him iot will remain underwat as a black lion has already been dispatched to theon 's Residence they wo n't kill him considering that he 's a part of the main family but next time he might no be so lucky iode will live the rest of his days under close watch and naturally his right to the be the patriarch has been nullified and forgotten also theonas is looking for someone Adept in Magic to teach him but the you 're just going to let that happen as if someone is behind all of this they may try to go get in touch with him soon enough Keon thinks of iode and how much he loved magic when he was young how it fascinated his still untrained mind what happened for him to get into dark magic like this the next day day they get ready to leave but not before seal and Keon say goodbye to Eugene Carmen turns to him and asks what he thinks about joining the black lion order as the second division Captain 's subordinate position is empty now so if he wants he can recommend him right this instant Eugene refuses instantly and she notes that it 's a real shame with that they drive away and Eugene asks roarian why the malakith did n't come to send them off as she 's the white magic Tower Master roarian explains that she would have been the first here to brag if the contract was successful but it seems that she 's running into some issues with it right now at her residence she pours all of her Mana into the sword while butt booty naked which she seems quite displeased with to say the least she dams Tempest for not responding as she already sent a message to the spirit world and is also not heating up her body for maximum sensitivity while also being naked she tries to summon him once again and that 's lighting comes out of the sky King King of the lighting Spirits Levan arrives with a message from the wind King he told her to shut up already as he does n't want to form a contract with her she starts spewing thins about being the greatest in the world and starts Swinging The Sword around which Levan finds quite shameful he sigh and electrocutes her enough to stop her from going mad he explains that she can not give what Tempest wants as the hurricane wishes you to move northward the Norther region of the demon realm that nobody was able to conquer a wish he has not been able to forget for centuries the next day she looks like an old granny as she comes next to Eugene who is quite confused that she aged so fast he asks how the contract went and she urges him to not do that as he knows clear as day what happened she starts screaming about Tempest damning him for everything myrr who was there has had enough and tells her that this is a place for silence but malakith is going straight crazy at this point Eugene asks if Tempest really blew her off like that and she asks why she would like about such an important thing to her Eugene explains that if they wait until today it will be 10 years of lending so he will be nice and call it 9 years if he gives back winad now she reluctantly does so and urges him to take great care of her Cape Eugene goes back to his reading where he finds out the chief of the Giants Kish was extremely huge he was hundreds of years old and the strongest Chief in all giant history thousands of humans against hundred of giants which were n't that few as none of the soldiers wanted to fight something that could kill them with their step but the soldiers did n't matter as vermouth was there the Knight who thought they were powerful came and spouted some nonsense in introducing themselves which nobody really cared about they wanted to fight together with him but all of them combined would n't make a dent in kamash toe vermouth had only one person who could fight alongside him and whom he depended on Hamill they were ready to fight the\",\n",
       " \"deadly Giants and vermouth was successful in defeating kamash who was as powerful as a demon king even with their leader dead the Giants did not turn back and still wanted to end Humanity however seya showed them true power Eugene asks if senya wrote this book as it has too much praise regarding her is all may notes that this is an insult to her as who would write a story about themselves and praise their own name like this he gets up as he wants to try reading witchcraft again May is glad but he is too arrogant for the level he is currently at Eugene notes that he likes succeeding in difficult tasks even if it takes him a while he gets to Witchcraft and thinks that it 's impossible for him to recreate the Eternal hole now as he would need at least Ninth Circle it 's a great circle that holds circles that are infinitely increasing in power and one can rotate it destroy it recreate or even increase their Mana but he does n't use a circle as he uses the White Flame method to create a substitute but if he can add one more ring inside of that ring made by the Stars what he learned in his past life was some cheap Mana training used by Common soldiers he added to that with his experience and senya helped as well that is how haml created his own Mona Training Method grow the core and repeatedly explode the Mana that makes the core spread the Mana that 's been sped up around the body with that haml was successful in even damaging kamash he remembers his comrades especially senya who thought that this method is garbage but his level did increase quite a bit he looks over the Eternal hole as he does n't pass out anymore by looking at it he can actually feel it too meaning that he can do it Eugene lionhardt will recreate this hole by using the White Flame method 2 years pass and Eugene turned 19 Eugene 's 19th summer was spent writing his thesis myrr who is on the other side of the table from him asks if he 's not hungry as it 's almost time to eat Eugene says that he will be having some food shortly as if he leaves now he will lose all concentration on what he is writing Mar asks why he is such in a hurry while writing in the first place and Eugene explains that it 's much better to write slowly so there are no mistakes made it just feels more right he is also not rushing himself and making sure he does n't make any mistakes while also revising constantly but he has n't made many mistakes he is just paying close attention to what he is writing that is all May notes that Mages complete a thesis about magic over entire Decades of their lives Eugene in turn says that it did n't take him decades to learn magic so why should be like them may gets up and notes that this is precisely it it is very arrogant for him that he is already writing a thesis he should just quit that and concentrate on just learning for at least a few more years then write his thesis Eugene notes that she is being quite shy and she urges him to not cross that line as she has already told him count countless times to not refer to her that way she has lived for at least 200 more years than him so she demands at least some respect Eugene calls her a shy little Grandma Mar which makes her wonder if she should just kill him and be done with it later Eugene asks if she does n't want him to leave and she is a little shy to say Eugene explains that he has come and gone here for 2 years yet he is the only one who still comes here on the regular May notes that is pretty obvious even to the untrained eye as other Mages already saw witchcraft a long time ago the Mages who witnessed it were amazed and shocked to their fiber and desperately tried to analyze and understand it fully however in the end they all failed to do so and gave up instead trying to complete their very own magic but he has come to acrion every day for 2 years straight and tried to understand witchcraft to the best of his abilities is he really going to leave aroth once his thesis is completed Eugene asks what else he could do here if he did n't and and may explains that he can do a myriad of things she does n't know exactly when the red magic Tower Master will retire but she 's quite certain he would gladly take him on as his successor Eugene says that he does n't want to be a magic Tower Master as the job seems to be quite dull M notes that another option is joining the palace Mage troops as the captain trle seems to want to recruit him Eugene says that he acts way too friendly which he does n't like at all mayor notes that the prince has also taken a liking to him and if he would be able to work with him in any way he would be able to boast and brag about it for decades to come Eugene says that he does appreciate that he likes him quite a bit but he does n't feel like doing any of that Mar is quite puzzled at this point as he ca n't become a patriarch in the first place so why does he want to go back to the lion Hearts so much Eugene asks if he really needs a big or grand reason to go home and may explains that what he has accomplished these past few years is extremely impressive Even In Her Eyes in just the half year that he has started to write his thesis he has managed to simplify complicated and elaborate magic theories while also improving his own magic during the whole process Eugene explains that this thesis is just for his own satisfaction as he is the only one who can use it in the first place he 's just writing it down because he likes his things organized and he 's not going to reveal it to the academic Association anyways no Mage would be able to use the circle flame method in the first place he thinks of the time when roarian told him that not taking magic and understanding into account is physically at least impossible he does n't use a normal Circle magic method for his magic and his substitute is the White Flame metho stars with the circle but that wo n't mean that the main family 's White Flame method users can replicate it he also tried it according to his thesis but he was stuck from the very beginning as he has never made a core or learn the White Flame method he tried to substitute it with his Circle but his Mana ended up flowing in Reverse instead Eugene had become a white flame method four star and successfully added Eternal hole to the circle he made a ring using four stars and constantly exploded the Mana within just like Hamill did in his past life the rotating Ring of Fire ensures that the Mana does n't flow outside of the circle that is the circle flame method he made Eugene planned to attempt all of this once he became a five star but having looked upon witchcraft he changed his mind instantly he spent a a very considerable amount of time on the sixth floor the Hall of space and on the eighth floor the Hall of intense heat the Hall of intense heat had magic from the world 's most powerful and renowned flame Mages and he needed to learn Space Magic in order to properly utilize the Cape of Darkness to the best of its abilities roarian took Eugene as his direct pupil and helped revise his thesis he also helped Eugene fix some basic Circle magic spells to work with his Circle flame method all of this time he has spent half of his time in acon and the other half learning magic from roarian if there is an adjective that would fit these two years he spent in aoth it would be rigorous Eugene asks Mar if she 's mad at him for saying that he will leave even though she clearly does n't want him to Mar explains that she is not mad at all as she has no right to stop him from leaving in the first place so he can go if he wants to go she 's\",\n",
       " \"never had the desire to go somewhere but even if she would really want to she could n't in the first place so he should leave and leave her all alone here in this boring quiet and very lonely place she is not sad in the slightest about saying goodbye after they spend all of these years together she 's not a living human and she knows all too well that humans do whatever they want to Eugene wonders if it 's so while putting his thesis away and she notes that it is as she has live a much longer time than him and is used to goodbyes however he should at least tell her before he leaves and instead of leaving her all alone without saying a thing like sea did Eugene responds with a simple all right which causes her to be angry as she has poured her heart out to him but he is still too calm he 's just a sack of crap Eugene asks how he is so and she explains that it 's because it 's what she thinks and the how is not important he is just a sack of crap and that 's that actually she really hates him as he 's just a kid but hold no respect for his Elders is it really that hard to listen to an adult now and then she stops for a second and says that if he were to stay in a Roth because of her she would feel quite baffled as her personality is based on a younger sea so her emotions and behavior can be childish sometimes so sometimes she says childish things and she 's quite stubborn she 's as very aware of this fact she also is feeling quite stupid for telling him this as she knows sea would n't act like this and it feels like she 's insulting her with this outrageous behavior Eugene smiles and says that the real SAA would have acted just like her or at least he thinks so may notes that there is no chance she would actually act like this and he would n't know since he never met her Eugene says that he 's certain she would act like this and may wants to know how just because of what he read in the picture book that is written by someone else with a big imagination and the Sea she knew would never do something like this Eugene explains that his thesis will be completed soon and if he 's not too greedy about it it will most likely be finished before summer ends May asks why he told her this and he says that he will visit her before he leaves and will tell her something important then Mar asks if she 's going to make fun of her as she would n't suggest that she will really kill him Eugene smiles and notes that she will know once the time for that comes while leaving he meets with trle and his face immediately drops into an annoyed expression he asks what he wants now while thinking that since he 's the palace Mage captain it 's obvious what he 's going to talk about trle notes that the position that they talked about previously that is empty in the palace Mage troop is still empty so if he changes his mind in the meantime he knows who to talk to Eugene thanks him for the offer but does n't really want to trle also notes that if he would like he could help by checking his dissertation he is very aware that his mentor is roarian and already proofreading it but does n't he specialize in summoning magic anyways he is also good with summoning Magic but also great with the combat variant he is not a palace Mage troop Captain for not reason after all Eugene says that even if it 's so he still does n't know what he 's writing about in the first place trampel thinks that it 's because he only shows it to roarian and keeps it extremely well hidden while saying that he could get to know since he 's accustomed to teaching others as much as the magic Tower magic themselves Eugene thanks him for the proposition but if he were to accept right now it would be seen as offensive to roarian trample notes that it can indeed be seen in that light so how about they keep it a secret Eugene turns his back and excuses himself leaving trampel to sigh while leaving Eugene thinks that if this guy ever found out about the Eternal hole he would have crawled into his bed at night the circle flame method is n't all too different to the White Flame method up until the magic is cast that is even a great Mage like trampel would n't really be able to notice the difference just by having a look at it being able to hide one 's abilities from high rank ining Mages comes with its merits it seems while training roarian explains that disregarding what magic spells he can cast if they just consider the sheer force he is putting into them he has passed the fifth Circle already Eugene notes that fourth circle is his current limit as more advanced magic than that would n't be able to hold itself in the Eternal hole is his understanding perhaps not good enough roarian thinks that it 's probably not that and it 's most likely that the hole reached its content limit he has has n't recreated the Eternal hole with the circle flame method perfectly just yet he is substituting his circle with his core four White Flame method stars and four cores to be exact it 's more accurate to see it as the number of cores being the same as the number of circles with each advancement that his White Flame method goes through his Circle flame method also gets stronger but he should exercise caution as the circle flame method right now does n't have any disadvantages the risk might be gathering itself each time he levels up since the this is a magic method that nobody has heard of ever before additionally he has already told him this piece of information many times but he should n't use Advanced Circle magic ever unlike the regular Circle magic method the circle flame metho will allow him to use highlevel Circle magic and he will be able to use magic up to fifth Circle quite easily but he should never attempt to use sixth Circle magic as they do n't know what dangers using Magic One ca n't organically use might be Eugene says that he understands and roarian notes that he probably wo n't return to the lion Hearts immediately after finishing his thesis right is there somewhere he plans to go specifically Eugene notes that he will go to the luhar kingdom since he wanted to eat their Infamous ice crab since he was a little kid the real reason he is going there is because it 's the nation that dumb bastard [ __ ] established somehow roarian notes that there are ice crab restaurants here in aroth as well but Eugene excuses this by saying he wants to eat directly from the source after enjoying some ice crabs in luha he will go to nahama as he heard that the cactus scorpion is great there putting that horrifying creature aside the reason he is going there is because 200 years ago anise who had been praised and revered as a saintus in the Holy Empire Urus left on a pilgrimage without telling the emperor the purpose of it the last place she was ever seen was in the middle of the nahama desert roarian did n't see him as such a foodie but if he likes Crustaceans this much they should have lobster for today 's meal they go to a lobster restaurant where Eugene thinks that he did n't expect to meet hon name aro 's Prince here he apologizes for intruding on a meal between teacher and pupil but he will get to the main topic now he tells Eugene that if he stays in a Roth he will promise him the position of captain of the palace Mage troop he swears this on his family name Eugene notes that right now something like that would be difficult for him to do right hame notes that in 10 years he will become the king of aoth his words surpris roarian who notes that something like that is quite dangerous to say as the current King is very healthy hon name asks that he does n't misunderstand as he has already received a promise that he will have the throne so his succession is basically guaranteed Additionally the people of aroth\",\n",
       " \"also believe that he will become king the palace Mage troop answers directly to the king and he will also go through some processes out of respect for the Senate but he should be qualified enough in about 10 years Eugene thanks him for for judging him so highly but he does n't really know how much he 's improved hame explains that it 's because he and roarian keep that fact very well hidden but why there must be a really good reason they wo n't tell anyone he assumes he takes a look at him and sees that his body is chalk full of mana and just by that he must at least be a fifth Circle he brings up the topic of Witchcraft and asks Eugene if he understood the Eternal hole at all Eugene asks if he really has to answer that and hame notes that ask that is plenty enough for an answer Eugene explains that he should n't lie to the prince though he also did n't plan on being that honest either it 's not that he hates a rooth or the position of Palace Mage troop Captain but he just does n't want it hon name notes that with his abilities and potential earning a position of power is very easy for him so power alone could n't tie him to this place what about education however as he knows seya created three series of Witchcraft one is an acrea on the very same he studied and the other two are being kept in the Royal palace 's treasury this shocks both Eugene and roarian and Eugene thinks that Mar said seya had the other two with her roarian asks since when did the Royals get the other two and hon name explains that Unfortunately they are only copies seya gifted to them as a token of affection as even the Royals have n't a clue as to where seya and the other two copies have gone Eugene asks if he 's really going to show him the other two copies and hon name explains that right now now it 's just not possible and it is true that he has won great favor with the King but witchcraft is the greatest magical text in all of history and even he ca n't do whatever he wishes to with it but when he becomes king he can use his powers to show him witchcraft but he ca n't help roarian in that regard so what does he say as this clearly is n't a bad offer Eugene thinks that this is quite the thoughtless offer as he has already experienced substantial change because of the first witchcraft so how much stronger will he be come if he gets a hold of the other two that is not all as maybe just maybe the other witchcrafts could have information about Sea 's location as he would know better than anyone where to look he notes that it 's impossible right now so he will drop by aoth once he has ascended the throne that is and they can continue this discussion at the time hame notes that he is smart to leave his path open and will send him a letter once his Ascension has been solidified later mayor checks his thesis and thinks that the core and eternal whole have been combined perfectly and there is still the incompleteness that existed from the start but she ca n't think of anything that would improve this even though it 's not as good as saa 's Eternal hold technique his Circle flame method is still amazing she notes that it 's quite wellmade but from her point of view this is incomplete but he is acting like it is does n't he feel selfish he 's the only one who uses it after all and by his standards this level of completion is great however now that he has completed his objective he will leave the question is when Eugene notes that he will leave the day after tomorrow as he needs a day to rest he is still Human After All also roarian said that he would be holding a farewell party for him May says that it must be great as he will eat tons of delicious food and everyone will be congratulating him Eugene smiles and notes that it 's about time they talked about the thing he wanted to tell her he has something to check before that but can he tell someone else what he wants and tell her and have them pass it on to her my finds his attitude disgusting as he is clearly suspecting her of showing other people his thesis which she would never do Eugene asks if she did tell anyone but she swears that she did n't and that every magic Tower Master harassed her endlessly to try and know about it it would be impossible even if witchcraft was dissected and someone tried to listen to it by using sheer force all of the information and conversation of the Mages that were obtained by researching witchcraft are kept in the deepest corner of its storage medium all of this is n't because he is special it 's just a function with the purpose of respecting the security and family of Mages who enter acon unless somebody completely annihilates witchcraft there is no way any of his information will be leaked Eugene notes that if it 's this secure then what is about to say also wo n't get leaked out he reincarnated and still has memories of his past life Mur finds that extremely hard to believe and thinks that it 's some kind of bad joke Eugene explains that his name in his past life was Hamill dinus he is Hamill the foolish me is quite surprised and Eugene asks if it 's that hard to believe M notes that some things start to make sense if that 's true as he managed to understand the Eternal hole after just two years of studying Magic and was also able to emulate it with his Keen sense and change it into something that suits him nicely however if he remembers his past life and used to be comrades with the great vermouth he might be Hamill he was a unique individual in many ways senya grew up with the elves and learned Magic from them [ __ ] was the brave son of a great Chieftain of the bayar tribe that was well knows for being a tribe which reveled in battle and lived in the north anise was always a saintus candidate who the Cardinals of the Holy Empire spent their whole lives molding and vermouth was initially a slave he was among those who were dragged away to become offerings of the demon race and he stole the sword of a demon to try and survive at any costs with that first sword he swung he cut down thousands of demons and dark Mages who were escorting the slaves while he led them and tried to escape helmod he cut down endless demonic beasts Mar notes that she thought that the story was exaggerated but that 's how Legends usually end up like Eugene notes that he was n't there but it 's probably true as that guy was a monster through and through Hamill is the most unique from the hero party as he did n't start with cheat stack like vermouth or have a special upbringing like the others he simply picked up a sword to survive after his village was butchered and destroyed by monsters he became a mercenary filled with hatred towards monsters and any demonic being including the Demon King despite having the most common background he was able to grow and become strong enough to stand amongst the heroes for years now that she knows he is haml his outrageous growth state is explained although the haml who appeared in the book had a bad personality he was also exceptional when it came to growth Eugene explains that is n't the whole truth as he tried to surpass vermouth countless times and trained with countless weapons but still the outcome was almost always the same and he never beat him May wonders why would have challenged that Beast as he was quite a monster in terms of stats and abilities Eugene notes that he did n't care and only wanted to beat him at least once but was n't able to do so may asks why he called himself handsome previously as that is a very selfish thing to do Eugene does n't find it weird as even in his past life he was quite attractive M asks why is he telling her all of this she does n't know a thing about senya 's whereabout either Eugene says that he 's not\",\n",
       " \"telling her all of this and hopes for some information it 's just that he has known her for 2 years and she resembles seya a lot in both personality and looks May notes it 's because she has seya as a Basse Eugene Pats her head and asks if he 's crossing a line just now may notes that she will forgive him just this once since he is or was senya 's comrade Eugene asks if she thinks seya die but she thinks otherwise as she could n't have Eugene says that he believes it to be so as well as she would have left a will behind so he is going to look for her seya [ __ ] anise he 's sure they are all living somewhere in this world and he will find all of them May is shocked by his words and asks if he will really be able to bring seya back Eugene in turn asks if she misses seya which she does as she has n't seen her in so many years he notes that if that is the case he has all the more reason to bring her back but she has quite the ugly side right she ignored her familiar spirit for well over two centuries which does n't seem all that kind Mar asks him to not talk about seya that way but he notes that he of all people should be allowed to as in the past she talked a lot of crap without any backing Mar asks that he swear in front of Witchcraft that he really is haml the foolish of Legend Eugene says that he will to show that he is but can she take the foolish out when he is referring to him as it 's quite annoying they make their way to Witchcraft and Eugene puts his hand up while swearing his name is Eugene lionhart and he was hamlus in his past life he swears this upon his blood and the lionart family name that he is telling the truth and only the truth me who now seems to be connected to Witchcraft has no reaction and explains that after senya disappeared mysteriously many Mages tried to take apart Witchcraft and her however there is something that they were never able to find out no matter how much they looked the information recorded at the very bottom of witchcrafts roots what they will talk about now will be saved here and not revealed to even the most trusted companions or confidants what she is about to speak right this moment is also something that is unknown to all of a wroth there were signs before seya went into retirement Eugene is quite shocked by this and asks her to explain further myrr notes that after a week before seya departed she was on this very floor of acon with her that 's when completely out of the blue she fell to the floor and started to groan when she asked what was wrong senya explains that she had this reaction because her familiar Spirit had died the same familiar Spirit positioned at Hamill 's grave she said that somebody must have broken into his grave and was extremely angry like she has never been before Eugene is surprised that he had a grave in the first place as he thought that his body was left to rot M says that was the first time she heard about it and not long after this Revelation senya disappeared and she hid the conversation within witchcraft since it was something she did n't tell a single soul before Vanishing she just did n't want to put her in an even more difficult situation in case that was something she should n't talk about at all but since he is Hamill her oldest comrade and friend he deserves to know about it Eugene notes that he never heard a single thing about his grave as he thought that his body would have simply vanished because of Beal 's curse since A 's curse destroys both body and soul may says that yes normally that is the case but his soul was fine and he reincarnated that means that his body is also intact somewhere too Eugene notes that if that really is the case senya really might have been involved in his reincarnation after all later that night while walking on a Lonely Road Eugene thinks that if seya was really the one to dig him a grave it would be hidden somewhere and quite well but where could it be people usually choose places that are important to them for grave sites so it would n't be where he died could it be his homeland of all places that 's when bzac comes from behind him and asks if he can hear him Eugene notes that he already knew he was being followed by him but chose to ignore him on purpose bzac says that no matter what he never seems to be in a good mood when he sees him does it have to do with him Eugene instantly says yes without any sense of holding back bzac explains that he came because he heard something about him that he is leaving aroth in order to go to luhar and nahama he is quite worried about his safety as the northern luhar region is very close to helmet Eugene asks why that would be of any importance and Balzac notes that he only means the lionard influence will not work there as luhar used to ban the entrance of demons and dark Mages but the royal family suddenly changed their minds 5 years ago there are tons of demon species in helmed and some of them disobey their rightful Master the demon king of incarceration however the demon king of incarceration is n't the only Demon King inside of helmet Eugene asks if what he is saying is that the demon king of Ruin is preparing for another grand War but B Z denies it he explains that the demon king of Ruin does not enjoy violence and respects the great demon king of incarceration deeply if he wo n't incite something neither will the demon king of Ruin they have agreed to that Eugene thinks about the situation and notes that the demon king of Ruin is most likely the strongest of the demon Kings he saw him a single time in his past life but he is still not sure what he saw to this day in a wide dark plane a single color of sorts was moving nobody dared to suggest that they fight or try to kill the thing and if anise had n't prayed for everyone to calm down they would have all surely gone insane from the pressure Balzac notes that even if the demon king of incarceration is malevolent and the demon king of Ruin is silent it does n't mean that every demon follows the same rules Demons by Nature are violent creatures and there are many amongst their ranks that are rather irritated by the centuries of Peace he finds it funny now that he is the one to say this but demons are n't really the species made for peace Eugene asks if he is saying that they could do something to him despite the demon Kings maintaining this peace Balzac explains that a hefty number of them would certainly want to this does n't go just for the demons under his great king but also for those who server the demon king of Ruin they will do just about anything to break the Silence of their silent King there are also higher power demons that wish to be one of the new demon Kings since there are only two of the five remaining there are three empty positions Duchess zabella is one of the demons that yearns this position and very much so Eugene jokingly notes that they should just vote on it or something but bzac says that demons would just destroy the voting box if they did n't get the results they want Eugene thinks about zabella which is the night witch Queen not an easy to get title can he really hope to beat a higher power demon with the skills he is currently holding however there is no guarantee to it and winning might be possible right now he does intend to go to luhar someday but not yet if that is the case Eugene thanks him for the kind warning and notes that he will be visiting nahama first and luhar later Balzac thinks about nahama and urges him to be careful when going to the deserts not because of the sandstorms or creatures but because of Amelia Merwin she was once a great dark Mage even before she signed a contract with the Mighty Demon King of\",\n",
       " \"incarceration he allows him a ton of freedom but that freedom is doubled for Amelia if he were to ever come across her he should hand her this if he does so even if he did something harmful to her she will not harm him Eugene asks what this is bzac says it 's an envelope as he can see Eugene asks if he can open it and bzac allows him he rips off the wax and is surprised by what he finds inside nothing he found nothing Balzac explains that the contents of it are unimportant what is important is that he possessed the letter he wrote personally he snaps his fingers and another envelope falls into Eugene 's hands bzac notes that he ca n't do anything about the many unexpected dangers he meet while in nahama but he will be able to deal with Amelia 's famous nasty temper if he truly insists of going to nahama he should take this with him Eugene asks what he wants in return for this and Balzac says that he ca n't do anything about his disdain for dark Mages but he should take this as a small gesture of Goodwill you Eugene takes no time in asking him if he swings the other way which leaves Balzac speechless Eugene explains that he is a little suspicious and always treats him well so it 's not like he is biased towards him but it 's a little burdensome for The Dark Tower Master to be this friendly ballzack tells him to wait a bit as he became quite flustered he should n't misunderstand as he simply wanted to build a close relationship one human to another not because of what he proposed he excuses himself further and Eugene notes that he will accept this graciously since he already gave it to him in All also he is very thankful for what he did and would like to invite him to his Farewell tomorrow but he should n't turn up just because he said that human feelings are quite irritating as he wants to invite him but if he does turn up it would make him hate him even more that he has Balzac says that he will not be coming in that case and Eugene thanks him once again for his endless generosity with that he leaves and the next day everyone is at the farewell party the Blue Magic Tower Master comes behind Eugene and asks why he invited him Eugene notes that they already know each other so why not the blue Tower Master notes that he also knows the rest of the magic Tower master so why did n't he invite them as well Eugene notes that he must already know exactly why he did n't do that and he urges him to not shun the green Tower master and Palace Mage captain that much as they are only acting this way because he is extremely talented Eugene notes that if that is the case he must not be not talented enough for him the blue Tower Master size noting that he did want to take him under his wing but he would n't dare steal roarian pupil so shamelessly and he did expect this but he really did n't invite bzac here Eugene notes that indeed he has n't and roarian also would n't have liked to see him here either but since they are on the topic what kind of person is The Dark Tower Master anyways he heard that he was in the blue magic tower for a while and he was in the same batch of trainees as the previous blue Tower Master he explains that whether in his past or even now he has been mysterious and unfathomable more than 10 years ago Balzac was supposed to be the next Blue Magic Tower Master as he had endless potential but suddenly he left the blue Tower and went to helmet his reasoning was that he wanted to broaden his knowledge of the magic Arts at the time he was much weaker than Balzac but he was able to become the blue Tower Master after he left 10 years later Balzac became a dark Mage after coming back from his journey to Helmut and transferred to the dark magic Tower there he came the tower master and received a lot of support from the other dark Mages he would have been an exceptional blue Tower Master one of the best in all of its history but it seems that was n't really enough for him no matter how great a human is with their magic they are still just that a human it would be impossible to surpass the demon king after all he also heard that he is going going to nahama so he will tell him a bit about it the desert is quite unpleasant so this is n't some great advice so he should take it however he wishes if he really insists on going there he should hide the fact that he is a Lion Heart Eugene notes that roarian also told him the same thing the blue Tower Master explains that these times are quite unsettling as the Assassins of nahama who operate in the darkest places are said to be operating in the light these days he highly doubts that they would actually mess with a lion heart but it would be best to avoid attention as that would be the safest Eugene notes that he will keep that in mind with that the party ends and Eugene arrives at Nama geared up and ready to Adventure he thinks that this dark cape would draw a lot of attention in a scorching desert like this but fortunately it comes with Transformation Magic it also resonates with the senses of its owner so it 's taking care of both external and internal body temperature he checks the magic map roarian gifted him and notes that the coordinates on it are locked to where he is standing and it tells him where he is no matter where he is on this continent right now he is at the West End of nahama and if he keeps going north he will arrive at tath shortly he was going to look for his grave and visit his hometown first which is on the border of tath but there is no need to do that now for the last 300 years while he was gone the unnatural Sandstorm slowly started to Devour the nearby lands so that 's why his hometown which was on the border of tath became part of the everchanging desert tath is a small country so they had no choice but to give up the territories that became desert following all of that the areas that became part of the desert were subsequently called new territories of nahama people can naturally invade like that too but only idiots would think that the process of becoming part of the vast desert via the sandstorm was n't artificially produces by the sand Mages when the demon Kings Rose 300 years ago ago the demons and monsters went berserk nahama took advantage of this war and tried to invade Keel but they eventually failed because of vermouth he hated this country in his previous life and it has been 300 years but his feelings are the same in that case he will go find his tomb first and he asked the others to wait just a bit longer senya an and [ __ ] he will find them he is determined to do so with that he walks into the unknown ready to face anything a few desert people spot him walking the great desert and one calls him an amazing individual as usually foreigners like him hire Caravans or guards when they cross this vast desert but he is on his own and does n't even have a camel with him another perks up and says that perhaps it is a kind of ritual they know that he is 19 and will become an adult next year in their tribe 's Coming of Age ritual they send boys out of the tribe when once they are of age the man notes that even if he is right about this why would someone from the famous lionart family come all of the way to the desert to do it that he does n't know but besides that all they need to do is obey orders as he told them to make sure that the boy does n't enter the kajani desert the man thinks that was the only order they were given and although he does n't know why he is in no position to judge their Master 's decisions the other man notes that the lion hearts and the rumors they have are true as that kid is extremely fast\",\n",
       " \"even with him being unfamiliar with the desert terrain suddenly he spots something that upsets him and tells the man that he is coming this way and quite rapidly at that the man pulls up his binoculars to look and indeed Eugene is running towards them but how did he see them from so far away he also spots the White Lion Man signaling that right now Eugene is using the White Flame method he rushes through the desert like the wind and the man thinks that he is coming way too fast for them to do anything so they need to act now however this might be better for them He commands everyone to pull out their weapons as they are going to make him think they are Bandits they will steal a few valuables he has and he might be on his way afterwards they all do so and Eugene thinks that they sneaking skills are n't great so they ca n't be assassins they look like travelers from just their clothing but it 's most likely a disguise the leader of the group uses sword Soul which surprised Eugene as if he can do that he must be quite the skilled swordsman this makes him smile as for the past 2 years he has only been working with the pan more than the sword it was fun to learn magic true but he liked to be physical much more he pulls out his sword and clashes with the leader which makes his hand tremble he backs off and the others rush in they surround him but Eugene just summons a few magic circles and eliminates the weaklings in only one strike the leader is the only one left and Eugene asks him two simple questions who he is and why they are following him the leader notes that they are just Bandits nothing more Eugene says that if that is a case nahama is a really strong Nation even the leader of some measly Bandits can use sword Soul then a bandit group of a 100 must be much stronger and the nation must have soldiers that can take care of these Bandits so they also must be quite powerful how amazing as with such power nahama could unite the entire continent under one Banner the leader notes that they are just a little bit special and Eugene tells him to stop screwing around and be honest this time but he does n't really care if he does n't want to say as he will find the truth on his own eventually the leader wonders if this guy is really of the Lion Heart lineage as he looks extremely young but talks like a drunk mercenary plus that blood lust in his eyes is not something that a kid should have at his age suddenly Eugene disappears and appears behind the leader he notices and blocks the attack and thinks that if his Mana did n't break from the collision with sword Soul he must be using it too Eugene creates a large dust shield around which makes the man think that he will use the magic missiles again so he creates a Mana shield around him but Eugene destroys it with just a few hits of the magic Missile the leader is extremely shocked by this and Eugene comes out of the smoke ready to deal the finishing blow just before Eugene can end the life of the group leader with his blade being a few inches from his Sleek neck he backs away and smiles seeming to be an insult the leader wonders why he wanted to do that as it is an extremely offensive thing for a swordsman with Newfound courage or perhaps rage he charges towards him Eugene Dodges all of his attacks no matter how long or wide they might be and also guards against some he thinks that this is much better in terms of a fight as this is the first time he is really fighting someone who has sword Soul after his reincarnation he would also prefer more blood lust in this man 's attacks but this much is fine too Eugene swings twice and the attacks land on the leader 's arms who is shocked that he is moving so fast even if he 's been hit the wounds are n't deep at all so he can still move his arms this child is still going easy on him what an insult now more prideful than ever before he swings widely at Eugene who simply backs off and starts sheathing his sword after landing the leader asks why he is doing something like that as he has yet to surrender Eugene explains that he knows full well but he should n't be impatient as he will make him lose now with his bare fists that is this makes the leader reach a breaking point so he charges in without a care in the world but with a heart filled with anger against this disrespect Eugene Dodges his extremely open attack and punches him straight in the chest creating a crater he grabs his head and pins him to the sand with full force he asks one more question who is he the man immediately starts explaining he is Raman Schulhoff but this answer does n't please Eugene in the slightest so he pounds his head to the sand once again he does n't care at all for his name what he wants to know is who he is taking orders from the leader is hesitant to answer even with all of his injuries and a face full of sand in retaliation Eugene pounds his head into the sand again and again suddenly one of the group members pleads with him to stop as he will explain everything their master the one who gave the order is named Tyrie al-madani the leader tries to stop him from saying anything else but Eugene does the good old head in the sand trick and makes him stop talking Eugene asks who that might be and the member explains that sir al- madani is kian 's Amir Eugene thinks that kajian is a city that is places right beside the Western Gateway he came through so that means that this bastard he is holding is a subordinate of this town 's Lord the member continues noting that their Master ordered ordered them to chase Eugene lionhart Eugene asks where the master is in that sentence and the subordinate corrects himself Eugene also asks why he would order them to chase him like this but the member notes that they did n't get all of the details either all he told them is to make sure that he does n't make it to kayani so he should let their leader go now as he has answered all that he can Eugene does so and thinks that kajani is the name of the desert Straight Ahead from this place 300s years ago it was hamel 's Homeland but now it 's just the middle of the kajani desert that particular desert was only recently formed and is also the cause of all these sandstorms that have been eating away the land of trath does that perhaps mean that the sand mage 's base is in kajani a foreigner such as himself in that kind of place would surely get some attention so it 's to be assumed that such a person would n't want a member of the prestigious lionart family Waltzing around however out of all of these dangers the one he has to be most careful of in nahama is the one ballzack warned him about Amelia mwin she is also contracted with the demon king of incarceration so at least for now she is an extremely dangerous opponent the assur desert where her dungeon is rumored to be is very far away from here and also pretty far from where anise was last seen so he need n't go there for now at least Eugene Ponders the situation for a bit and sends the group members back while ordering the leader to come with him as he needs to get into kayani no matter what it takes so he will be the one to deal with things if any problems were to occur he probably gets now why he needs him right if they take orders straight from kajian Amir it 's to be assumed that he would solve any issues that might Rise by simply mentioning that he works for him the leader is hesitant to respond to this proposition and Eugene pushes him even further if he does n't like this pretty fair offer he can take a walk back to the lion Hart main residence and tell the patriarch that the Amir of kajian disguised some of his subordinates as Bandits and tried to steal a precious lionhart\",\n",
       " \"family treasure would he like that more the leader 's eyes are now filled with fear and he notes that they did n't have any such intentions Eugene pulls up his cloak and says that he just happens to have something very valuable on him does he recognize this sword Perhaps it is the Windstorm sword winned which the maker of the lionhart family the great vermouth used during during his life and also during the battle against the demons anyone would want something as precious as this so most people would actually believe him and think that cayan air caused all of this fuss because he wanted to steal wined the leader is now at a loss for words if this boy really goes around saying something like that not only will his head be rolling on the floor instantly all of his subordinates will be harmed as well or perhaps they wo n't even have time for that as their Master might be killed right off reluctantly he agrees to Eugene 's demands and says that he will do what he wishes this pleases Eugene so he begins smiling like a maniac with all of that all of the day they start to walk the vast desert while the leader thinks that he has betrayed his master like a coward as his straight orders were to stop this boy from ever entering the cayan desert and area so to go in now as his guard is just Shameless but what is more important of all what will happen to his subordinates who returned after failing to carry out their tasks Eugene gets his attention by calling him Raman and asks what his position in all of this is he begins explaining that he is the captain and leader of Legion 2 of the red desert Warriors and the main affiliate guard troops of al-madani the Amir of kajian Eugene guessed that he was pretty high in the food chain as he has the skills of a captain so it fits him quite well Eugene also asks if there are any Desert Mages to be hidden in the kayani desert which takes Raman by surprise as it seems he does n't know what he is talking about Eugene demands that he does n't play Dum lest he wants another one-sided beating Raman explains that he really does n't know but why in the first place would the desert Mages who are only loyal to the royal family be in this desert which is so far away from the capital Eugene gets closer to him and asks if he really is that dumb Raman asks what he is talking about and Eugene explains that the whole kajani desert was originally the territory of turath however a sudden Sandstorm turned the once luscious Forest into a vast desert nahama Sultan seeing all of this said that the desert was faded to them by the heavens and stationed his Warriors in the desert to take and train and that desertification is still going on fortunately for them they could never hope to do that if it were in the mighty Keel Empire that is why they are doing it to turath Raman does n't believe him noting that something like this is impossible even if he was right their Master would n't get involved into such a wicked matter it 's just not the person he is right now Eugene notes that he is much more naive than he looks as he himself is from kayani so he would assume that he survived the sandstorm purely by luck and were brought up to his feet by his master that must be why he does n't want to ever believe that his nice and kind Master could ever have anything to do with the sandstorm Raman does n't know what to say about it so Eugene urges him to at least keep this in mind as he does n't want to get in trouble with a foreign Nation anyways so he wo n't press further however he can guess why his master would n't want him to enter the kajani desert as things are going to become difficult once someone from the lionhart family steps inside of the place the desert Mages are hiding for the desertification Raman notes that he understands what he is saying and promises that if there are any Desert Mages like he says he will be the first to step up and protect him even if these desert Mages answer to the sultan directly they will show some respect in the place of his Great Master kajian Amir Eugene notes that he sure hopes so that is the case and gets moving again while trying to keep up with him Raman asks why he is going to the kyani desert in the first place as there is basically nothing there only sand Eugene says that he is here to find a grave this takes Raman by surprise as if he wanted to visit an ancestral grave he should have let him know earlier as there is a large graveyard in kajani and he would have directly taken him to it Eugene explains that the grave he is looking for is n't in a graveyard and it 's somewhere else entirely eventually they arrive at an oasis which puzzles Raman as something like this should n't be around here Eugene explains that it 's fake and not a mirage this one is purely illusion magic Rama notes that something like this is impossible why would anyone create a fake Oasis bis around here using magic Eugene pleads with him to keep his denial to himself from now on as it 's starting to get on his nerves oases like this one are very precious to Travelers of these deserts so when somebody sees one they are bound to want to rest around here Raman wonders if this means that there are some people waiting to Ambush them around here Eugene takes a step forwards and notes that they will see about that that 's when a knife silently rises from the sand and Raman tries to warn Eugene but he already noticed and jumps high in the air he uses the power of an intermediate ranked wind spirit gaale which blows the sand away and also sends Ramen flying for a bit the attacks hits the Assassin perfectly and also knocks him out the ground starts to rumble and many more assassins pop out of the ground ready to take Eugene out before the battle can commence Ramen rushes in and urges them to put down their Weaponry he gets in front of Eugene and explains that he is Raman Schulhoff a Warrior of the great Amir of kajian al-madani and this person is a prestigious guest of his master so they need to put down their weapons and back off of them if they do not they challenge the might of Catan 's Amir instead of backing off the Assassins surround both of them and clench their weapons tightly Raman is surprised that they would dare do something like this perhaps they did not hear this person is a most prestigious guest and a son from the great lionhart family Eugene grabs his shoulder and explains that it 's no use pleading with them and he 's just dragging this on and on at this point while making things easier for them Raman asks why that is and Eugene notes that they wo n't be able to send them back alive since they already dared to attack him but it would also be annoying to kill a lion heart so they will probably make him drink some poison or drug to make him shut up but to do that they would have to defeat him first Raman starts un sheathing his sword and thinks that there are a ton of them but he needs to help this young Master fight Eugene signals them to come at once and they do so one eventful day anise asked Hamill why he carried so many weapons he does n't even use he explained that one day they will be useful so why not seya told her to leave this bastard bee as he never listens anyways anise however did n't want to let it go as Hamill 's behavior is not good at all all of those weapons which see no use are Hamels so why is [ __ ] carrying everything for him Hamill explained that he won against him at rock paper scissors so this was fair and square anise however did n't think so why would he make a bet like that in the first place Hamill urged her to stop making it seem like he is the bad guy in all of this as there are a lot of things in that cart excluding his weapons her\",\n",
       " \"most beloved holy water is also in there and a ton of it plus [ __ ] axe which is probably the heaviest thing in there anise looked at him with intent and said that if the the only water was her own possession she would have carried it herself but the ones who consume it the most are he and senya Hamill then got on Sea 's case as he told her many times to cut back on the holy water and she should have just used summoning magic to store all of this stuff seya started screaming at him as he was the one that suggested they carry this stuff with them since it would have taken a while to get it with the summoning magic Hamill then asked for vermouths opinion and also why he is n't the one to be pulling on the wagon vermouth simply said that his weapons were n't in there and Hamill noted that it must be so great to have pocket inventory like his seya told him that she could teach him something similar if he begged on his knees that is all of these fights between each other have become great memories but now they would n't have insulted him so much about it if he had a cape like this one in the past he pulls it open and summons two Spears from it he will do it like he did in his past life like Hamill did the Assassins try to strike him but Eugene jumps high into the air and throws a spear directly into the head of one killing him instantly another tries to take advantage of this and strike but Eugene notices him and Dodges this Miss left him open to attack and Eugene impales him with the spear Landing down while doing so another assassin tries to take him out from behind but Eugene notices and swiftly moves behind him cutting his head of with a clean strike two other assassins pull up and they try to take him from the side but he throws a few knives with expert precision as he takes out three assassins two others try to Ambush him but he uses two swords to defend himself and strike at the same time in a dance of Blade and weapons he pulls out an axxe to strike another and uses the sword to kill one that was coming for his head from above he throws the axe into the head of an assassin while another hides behind he jumps high into the air but before he can even notice Eugene has him from behind with some magic giving him the opportunity to cut his head off more and more assassins come and while Raman watches as he overwhelms all of them this causes him to start shaking as he ca n't ever hope to help somehow this child is just too powerful Eugene summons all of his weapons and shortly after finishes the fight single-handedly Raman thinks that he did n't even try to use the most powerful tool in his Arsenal winned he only used magic for support he is also extremely trained with various weapons how amazing he notes that he should n't have killed them all but Eugene explains that assassins are trained to prioritize their mission above all else so even if they cut up their arms and legs they would n't hear a peep from them he also tells Raman that he can go back now since these assassins did n't care at all for his authority or who his master was so if he wants to he can leave as he has no reason to bring him along anymore Raman says that he ca n't go back like this and Eugene asks why does he want to check if what they talked about earlier is true or not perhaps Raman does n't respond and Eugene notes that him not talking is n't helping the situation Raman pleads with him to let him come as he will not be a hindrance at all he can promise at least that Eugene tells him to do as he wishes but he should n't expect him to help much that 's when the ground below them starts to rumble so Eugene jumps high into the air the corpses of the defeated assassins start disintegrating and Eugene thinks that they were used as sacrifices for some summoning Magic sure enough a large hole starts forming in the ground and Eugene feels that a ton of Mana can be felt from it something seriously dangerous is about to appear Eugene stands above the hole which is about to be created and Raman pleads with him to run while the sand slowly but surely transforms into a tornado one that could easily sweep him away Raman is quite puzzled by this occurrence as even though sandstorms are expected in this area it is very strange that one of such scale would appear basically out of thin air perhaps Eugene was right that the sandstorms which are swallowing the homes of people are creating by sand Mages like what happened to him where he had to watch his dearest Village be utterly destroyed which at the time broke him completely this can not be allowed to happen any further and so he valiantly charges into the sandstorm he tries to slash the sandstorm with all of his might trying to break its form and perhaps destroy it unfortunately for him even after this attack the sandstorm stands untouched and the slash which he has put in it slowly gets covered Raman is on his last legs now thinking that now there is nothing he can do he 's basically doomed he also starts to sink even further in and Eugene is still flying still he is doing this because he ca n't escape the sandstorm using Gail 's wind as it would just try to suck him back in So holding on like this is the best he can really do perhaps then he should just use Blink and and teleport out of this area but now he does n't really want to as something very big and perhaps even more dangerous is coming out of the sand he spots Raman barely Holding On And snarls while picking him up with magic and throwing him away he tells him to run away already is he dumb or something that 's when a gigantic sandworm appears right below Eugene and before he can react it swallows him whole Raman is extremely shocked and very sad as in order to save him you genene chose to be swallowed by this Beast he clenches his sword tightly and thinks that now he will repay this almost unpayable debt as a true warrior should he will be the one to slay this Mighty sandworm and save the young Master even if it cost him his life inside of the sandworm Eugene just Falls thinking that sandstorms are one of the few monsters that can completely erase whatever they eat using energy so naturally they do not have any excretory organs so technically it would be impossible to get out once some someone gets in that 's not a problem for him however as he just needs to cut himself out of situation he starts using the White Flame method and also the circle flame method creating a powerful mass of energy soon enough he crashes through the backside of the sandworm and arrives into a cave which is rather empty and dark he looks at the wound of the sandworm and thinks that the summoning magic only attracted the sandworm so it was n't summoned it only just resided in this region then perhaps what he descended onto to is a sandworm nest when Mages want to focus on some rather dangerous research and not expose themselves to others they make things called dungeons in this vast desert the Mages nicknamed sandworms dungeon makers he remembers when seya told him that sandworms naturally dig into the desert and create rather stable labyrinths one can be created in around 10 days and apparently if left alone long enough a sandworm will create a complex and deep underground dungeon all a mage needs to do is slay the sandworm after getting the desired size and use some reinforcement Magic on the structure to ensure that the whole desert does n't just drop on you at the time Hamill asked her if she is going to do the same thing too which she found as an insult as she has no need to hide herself into a creepy dungeon like that Eugene pulls out his map and notices that there is a path among the countless entrances and this dungeon might actually lead to where Hamill lived his homeland with Newfound confidence he moves forward Raman wakes up from\",\n",
       " \"his days tied up by sand Mages and demands to know where he is situated one of them notes that it was rather amusing to see him charge in so foolishly against the sandworm did he really think that he could kill such a beast at his measly level well that does n't really matter now as they have brought him in here to ask him a couple of easy questions Raman is cautious at this point and ask what types of questions the sand Mages explains that they want to know more about Eugene lionhardt more precisely why the spoiled Brad of the lionhart family is going around in the kayani desert and even more importantly why is he the warrior of the Amir of Katan acting like a tour guide for him Raman just looks at them while sweating making the sand Mage think that just maybe the Amir of kajetan the presumed to be great Tyrie al-madani is planning to betray nahama it is only natural that this is his first thought as it is his sole duty to prevent people from entering this area with his life if he has to but now his very own Warrior is doing the exact opposite thing how strange Ramen asked them what they are doing in here as the Oasis above them was an illusion and the sandstorm that came afterwards was most likely created by Magic are all of this not their doing the sand Mage notes that he really does n't understands the situation that he is in it seems he uses magic to twist his arms even further and another Mage explains that in here they are the ones that will be asking the questions so all he needs to do is keep his mouth shut tight for the sake of his master 's honor at least the other Mage notes that try as he might he will die here no matter what so instead of an awfully painful death should n't he wish for the peaceful one he will ask him again why is Eugene of the lionhart family doing in kayani he clearly had a purpose since he entered nahama so the only conclusion they can really come to is that the kitan Amir is trying to betray the whole nahama Raman thinks of his words betray to be exact making him come to the conclusion that his great leader al- madani was always a part of this scheme he starts screaming at them they are such Petty creatures using Petty means to destroy the territory of another Nation they are the ones who should be protecting the royal family with their lives if they have to so why are they all here were those sandstorms from above trying to also progress the desertification too the Mage explains that he is wrong about that as in order to create a sandstorm large enough to cause such an event as desertification they would need many more people at least hundreds of professionally trained sand Mages if not more Raman asks what their purpose for being here is and the Mage once again twists his arms noting that they are in no way obligated to answer his silly questions why is Eugene lionhardt in kayani Raman tells them that it does n't matter anyways as Eugene has already passed away since he was SW followed by the sandworm they attracted one of the Mages says that perhaps it was better for him to die like this since his life is basically worthless anyways that 's when start discussing something about how one of them found the sandworm that swallowed Eugene and also that it had a large hole in its backside if potentially he broke out of there they ca n't let him poke around this place no matter what happens they also have assassins roaming about so he will be caught soon enough this fills Raman with hope as maybe just maybe Eugene will rescue him the Mages discuss what to do with him once they have captured him and one suggests that creating needless conflict with the lion Hearts is unwise so they will just erase his memories and throw him out of kajani or even better they should act as his protectors as they might receive some handsome rewards for their selfless actions right it quite nice that he is not here as he would have heard all of this unfortunately for them Eugene appears right next to them and stares with his golden eyes the Mages are now on full alert as they wonder what happened to the Assassins that were roaming the Halls one of them uses detection magic to see further in and finds out that all of them are lying in pools of their own blood and lifeless the one who saw all of this thinks that the Assassins were well acquainted with the maze to the point that they would be able to go around with their eyes shut combined with their exemplary stealth skills they should make make it extremely difficult for even an exceptional Warrior to catch them Eugene thinks that the Assassins that tried to stop him were n't that great as stealth is just a skill and they are not that experienced in terms of handling Mana the ones he fought in his past life which were also assassins of nahama were extremely Advanced and had the stealth skills that would rival demons they were also very persistent and most determined to the point where one would thinks that they are not humans anymore the ones in here are just awfully weak if this place really is important to nahama there should be better assassins put in place right is nahama or more importantly it 's Sultan not doing anything and lazing around Raman screams for him making Eugene finally notice that he is also there and wonder why he is in this place as he made it easy for him to run away previously what a dumbass he notes that he has a lot of questions for the Mages and approaches but that 's when one of them tries to encapsulate him in in some sand Eugene slowly pulls out the sword fragment and throws it at the sand while covering himself from the expected blast sure enough the sand disperses into a 100 places this surprises all of the Mages and they stare at Eugene who is holding the fragment of the sword while the dust around him clears one of them wonders what he did perhaps dispel but that ca n't be it as dispel is something that interferes with the Mana around the spell so what he did was getting rid of the Mana instantly a dispel like that should n't be able to exist not even in the great aroth is it perhaps some very secret lionart family technique all of this makes the Mage think that they ca n't capture him alive and unfortunate as it is they need to just kill him at this point lest he does that to them Eugene notes that they attacked first so naturally they should n't have any complaints if he wants to kill them too is n't that right the Mages are now on full alert and position themselves into a a formation they create a large shock wave made out of sand which makes Eugene smile when the attack almost reaches Eugene he throws his hand back and then releases the sword fragment at extreme speeds without any chance of reaction the fragment ends up into the head of a mage killing him instantly after that he uses this surprise to jump high into the air and gets ready to pounce the Mages attempt to summon some magic but Eugene already knows what they are doing it is extremely obvious as they are trying to make copies of themselves below but the real Attack is right above him he pulls out a whip out of his cloak and masterfully destroys all of the projectiles that come to end his life after that he grabs the head of one of the Mages with the whip and in gruesome fashion pulls it off after that he calmly lands in front of the last remaining Mage and asks him what they were doing here as this is not a random place the Mage is too afraid to speak and can only put out some murmurs and moans Eugene notes that they are far too weak to be a part of the Sultan 's real forces so are they perhaps doing something behind his back in here the Mage tries to deny it but Eugene throws a knife in his leg and explains that he does n't want to put any type of effort into questioning someone as lowly as him so he will give him two choices talk or Die the Mage\",\n",
       " \"notes that the things which are occurring in this place are not done under the command of the sultan Eugene asks if that is not the case then who is he working under the Amir of kajian is he the dumbass who is behind all of this conspiracy the Mage notes that the Amir of kajian is cooperating with them but now Eugene sees that this guy is trying to dodge the question again so he gives him some motivation to talk another knife in his leg this makes the Mage instantly speak explaining that the one behind all of this is Amelia Merwin this very place that they are standing on is Her Sacred dungeon Eugene asked asks him to not spout any nonsense as from the information he received Amelia merwin 's dungeon is situated in the assur desert which is quite far away from this place the Mage notes that she has been going back and forth from there to here for about 6 years give or take Eugene Ponders the information and asks why here of all places would she create such a meticulous dungeon the Mage seems to be too afraid to answer any further questions which makes Eugene think that he is very afraid of Amelia mwin so out of the kindness of his heart he will make this very easy for him he will die sure but he will kill him in a simple and perhaps even painless manner Amelia mwin would n't let him die a peaceful death at all but perhaps he already knows that this scares the Mage even further to the point where his eyes become bloodshot and so he starts explaining this dungeon was created with the purpose of quickening the progress of the desertification and there are many more dungeons like this one in the entire kayani dungeon but this one was made around 10 years ago almost 6 years ago the choice to expand this Labyrinth like dungeon was made and they assumed it was because the underground was unstable and had cracked over time but what they found was a gigantic gate deep underground they tried to open the door to that place but it did n't budge at all and so they asked Amelia mwin for help Eugene is satisfied enough with all of this information and so kills him swiftly as he has previously promised with this the restraints put on Raman also come loose and Eugene thinks that now the Warriors around here being so weak does n't surprise him they are all positioned in places like this under the direct command of Amelia mwin to remove any Travelers who would dare approach Raman gets his attention and advises to get out of this place as quickly as possible as if this is truly one of Amelia merwin 's Black Thorn dungeons they are in extreme danger at all times Eugene notes that they are already inside as it is and the chances of Amelia Merwin suddenly popping up are low as her true dungeon is in the assur desert Ramen explains that even with this she could come back at any moment as they do not know how she moves between them Eugene in turn asks him does he know what will happen if they leave this place she will most likely be after him even then anyways as she is adamant on killing anyone who dares Invader her territories and make a mess one way or another they will bump into her at one point he thinks that conflict with Amelia Merwin should be very avoided but at this point he does n't have much of a choice he looks at Raman and asks him why is he not running away because it is as he said this place is quite dangerous Raman explains that he has saved his life twice already and as a man if Amelia mwin comes back and tries to harm him in any way he will fight with his life if it means to help him Eugene notes that he does n't have any real skills to speak of so he should just go back where he came from and leave him alone already Raman refuses and is adamant on coming with him as his Warrior honor is at stake Eugene uses blink to teleport behind him and knocks him out cold while lamenting having to do this as he finds it quite annoying with that he leaves while thinking about how the dungeon was expanded 6 years ago he was 13 at the time when he had to take the blood succession ritual that is when he found Hamill 's artifact in the treasury and got it as a reward for his performance the Labyrinth had existed for 10 years already but some of it collapsed 6 years ago if perhaps the magic that was sealing the grave disappeared because he got the necklace it means that witch Amelia Merwin had messed with his grave eventually he finds the large hole that the Mage talked about and thinks that almost certainly this is where his grave is situated Eugene jumps down using his Gil abilities and eventually arrives at a sturdy metal door which seems to be open Eugene thinks that this is the door that the sand Mage talked about and Amelia mwin surely must have been the one to open it with no other feasible Choice he jumps down and spots that there are countless holes in the ground and also in the walls clearly signaling that there was a battle around here a fierce one at that was it senya perhaps he continues to walk through the halls and eventually finds something that surprised him to his core his grave which notes is so hamlus lived from 421 to 459 a piece of garbage idiot dumbass and straight up annoying but also Brave faithful wise and most importantly great this Tombstone is in Praise of him who has sacrificed himself for their all of humanity and left much earlier than he should have Eugene tries to hide his face and deny his emotions but they get the better of him and he starts crying uncontrollably while he does that he wonders why seya did n't say all of these things about him while he was still alive as he could n't have seen this gravestone if he was dead he continues to cry perhaps from sadness perhaps from gladness or perhaps both but eventually he stops and his eyes become puffy he thinks that the fight that was fought in here must have been quite Fierce as this grave is basically an utter ruins however the statue and memorial stone were untouched and pristine from his deduction it seems that 200 years ago senya senses that the familiar Spirit which was protecting this grave has died and left aroth to come protect Hamill 's grave that is when she fought the person who wanted to do something to the Grave most likely sure seya is strong always has been really but even more so after his demise the wise seya that he saw through witchcraft was someone that he could confidently say was the most powerful Mage in the whole world no questions asked however senya seems to have been unable to win as if she had won this battle she would n't have just left this grave standing in ruins she also did n't die in this dark place as the illusion he saw in aoth indicates that she is alive she must have been Gravely injured and thus retreated someone to hide but just who could injure her to that point a demon or perhaps even the demon Kings maybe it was the demon king of incarceration or maybe the demon king of Ruin sitting around here and pondering this situation wo n't help further so he needs to go and find senya first by looking around for a while as there may still be some Clues around here while walking around Eugene ca n't help but think about how his friends made this grave and how they most likely bald their eyes out while setting up the statue would have vermouth cried then because he ca n't really imagine him crying even after they defeated a most throw opponent and everyone was celebrating the victory vermouth usually looked around at his injured friends and criticized himself he said that he should n't have let them get injured and done better this bothered both Hamill and anise and mostly Hamill told him that he is also a human being just like them and ca n't do everything on his own if he thinks he does he should just go alone right at the time anise told Hamill to stop filling vermouths ear with nonsense but Hamill noted that he also saw her expression when vermouth said what he said\",\n",
       " \"so he must have felt the same way an told him that was n't aimed towards vermouth but him as she predicted that he was going to act like a baby Eugene thinks that he will never be able to have a conversation like that with his dearest comrades ever again which makes him almost cry so he stops thinking about it as his eyes will become even more puffier at this point that 's when he spots a large ornate metal door which is also opened a common trait in this place it seems when he goes inside of the room inside he finds only another door and some someone standing on the ground next to it Eugene ask the man to identify himself and also what is he doing in front of the door the man gets in a ragged fashion but soon stands valiantly almost like a knight Eugene tries to identify the being in front of him and comes to the conclusion that it ca n't be a demon as he ca n't detect a shred of life from him if that is the case this surely is an undead with this information Eugene Gnarls at him and demands once again to identify himself or else with a raspy voice the undead identifies himself as haml the foolish this information sends Eugene straight over the edge and he is now extremely angry is Hamill the foolish what kind of nonsense is he spouting now he is just a lowly death knight who has diluted himself into thinking that he is the great haml however Eugene ca n't ignore the facts this is Hamill 's grave and maybe that Death Knight has his body in a fit of rage he demands that he take his helmet off but the undead stands ever so proud which makes Eugene charge at him with all of his might before he gets to him Eugene jumps high into the air and asks which absolute bastard dared to put him in that body with those final words he tries to crash down on the undead but he Dodges and immediately goes on the Counterattack Eugene has plenty of time to dodge however and with this missed attack also the opportunity to attack him but the attack does n't go through as the undead is protected by a Mana Shield or rather since it 's a death Knight it uses demonic Force so that is a demon Force Shield the undead immediately gets on the attack and Eugene finds time to defend himself but the attack still sends him flying he thinks that this thing is plenty strong as his arms are really sore now just from that one attack the person who created this thing was probably Amelia Merwin herself six years ago when she opened the doors to the grave and made a death knight out of the corpse of haml however since there was no soul in the body she had to put another in if it is really like this it means that he can not hope to win at this point if it 's made by a dark Mage as advanced as amila Merwin then it might as well be as strong as the patriarch of the lion hearts or even the black lion Knight order Captain but even with all of this stacked against him frankly he just does n't care at this point as his heart is filled with rage he activates his Mana Circle and teleports behind him instantly and attacks with a spear which he manages to deflect the attacks do n't stop however and Eugene summons a large sword from his cloak and attempts to crush the undead like a tin can but he is too Swift and pushes Eugene right back in one final attempt Eugene tries to pull out something of the cloak quickly but the undead notices and stops the attack that was fast approaching this attack was done with a spear one of the many weapons Eugene is adept at the undead stops for a second and congratulates him for being so good at so many various weapons Eugene tells him that if he pretends to be Hamill the least he could do is fix his tone as he did n't talk like that ever the undead once again notes that his skills are admirable but still much too weak for someone like him in that Split Second he charges in and tries to slash Eugene this makes both of them exchange a few blows However unfortunately for Eugene his weapon does n't last for long and the undead charges in while saying that it 's a shame such a talented young man dying by his blade before the attack can land though the undead is pushed backwards and wonders what this child did to him that 's when he spots that Eugene is brandishing a dagger and comes to the conclusion that he simply parried the attack an admirable skill Eugene thinks that it was not only parrying but also a bit of magic as when he Felts the impact from the attack approach he aligned the sword sole with its Mana wavelength to deflect it entirely but that does n't stop the impact from being devastating as even with his perfect timing he is not yet strong enough to deflect such a powerful attack this is a fight that ca n't be drawn out so he will have to end it now even if it takes a lot out of him he starts revving up his Mana Circle even further and fights with all of his might against this tireless Undead he continues to fight and fight even when his bones feel like are being cracked with every attack and his muscles are being torn apart with every movement for him however it does n't matter as he did a lot more in his past life with a body that was less able so as long as his mental fortitude is fine he can still fight no matter what eventually his sword breaks but that 's when he pulls out winad and charges it with Mana while charging in once again while he was UN sheathing winned Eugene thought that even at the cost of his Mana Shield being weaker he will have to concentrate every bit of Mana straight into winned with that they continue to fight but Eugene does n't give the undead time to react as he relentlessly attacks him with every possible resource and charges An Almighty attack as he really wants to see his face this attack lands perfectly and sure enough the helmet that the undead brandished falls to the ground in pieces Eugene turns around and demands that the undead do the same reluctantly it does so and sure enough that is the face of Hamill which shocks Eugene to his core he tries to play it off by noting that as usual he is still pretty hot looking even after these years but unfortunately the soul inside of that body is extremely ugly and tainting the good looks this makes the undead rage and it screams so loud it can be heard throughout the halls in its rage it throws the sword directly at Eugene and charges in instantly afterwards making Eugene block a pretty hefty punch Eugene Retreats backwards and wonders why this guy got so fast all of a sudden as all he did was drop his sword this must be the nature of the soul to fight without a weapon as when he did he was much weaker but now what can he do as a death knight can instantly heal most injuries given to them so in order to kill one their heart needs to be destroyed no matter what however is he able to accomplish such a feat he has been parrying all of his Relentless attacks and used all of his strength to just get one attack in additionally if it was n't for the White Flame method he would have ran out of Mana long ago all of these thoughts are pushing him back though and all he needs to do is make it possible even if it 's not the undead charges in once again but this time brandishing a new kind of Weaponry Eugene tries to hit him with a few magic missiles like before but the undead moves like a beast and Dodges all of them Eugene notices that now his hands and feet are covered with demonic force and with his Savage combat style the beast-like posture and the craziness in his eyes Amelia must have put the soul of a lycanthrope inside of the body the undead does n't give him the time to think further as he rushes to MIM him but Eugene pulls out the Moonstone sword frag fragment and hits the Undead 's hand\",\n",
       " \"with it which creates a small hole through his demonic claws but does n't stop him from attacking he now knows that the most he can do is weaken the Demonic force not fully dissolve it so now he has to do things differently they both charge at each other at the same time and also deflect each other 's attacks Eugene however lets the undead land an attack on him giving him the opportunity to immediately turn around and put the sword fragment next to the Undead 's chest which makes him scream in sheer pain as the Demonic Essence slowly dissipates from him he tries to retaliate with some blood red beams but Eugene does n't falter and eventually the Demonic Force dissipates completely from its chest swiftly Eugene hits him with his sword and additionally he also summons countless magic missiles and aims all of them into the Undead 's chest afterwards The Shard falls to the ground and Eugene is also tired he looks at the undead which now has a gaping hole in it chest and notes that if he always had that disgusting thing in his chest he should n't have dared to call himself haml instead of a heart the undead that possesses the body of Hamill has a large red marble that protrudes out of his chest a little he immediately covers it up in shame and Eugene points it out clearly trying to mock him this makes the undead rush in while screaming and he bashes Eugene with his shoulder a move that sends both of them flying into a wall this makes Eugene spit out a lot of blood but even still still the insults continue he is just a fool that thinks of himself as haml but in reality he is only a mere death knight and not even human but a lycanthrope a beast with no Rhyme or Reason the undead affirms to himself that he is indeed haml as it is probably lost in terms of identity and is clinging to anything at this point Eugene flips him off which enrages the undead even further so it grabs both of Eugene 's shoulders with its beast-like demonic arms and slowly pushes him to the ground this makes Eugene truly wonder is he is going to die in this place but it 's not over quite yet as he ca n't just die a dog 's death after getting another chance at life his arm shakes as he thinks of a certain move one that would leave him unable to move for a long while so he ca n't miss no matter what however if he will use it winning is a certainty as he can rip this lowly death knight into mere pieces and even utterly destroy him so that he ca n't regenerate further The Recoil of this move though will incapacitate him instantly and hurt a lot there is no other choice but to do it as he does n't have the stats to go one-on-one with a death knight but if he uses that it will be his victory he has no choice but to use the ultimate skills of Hamill ignition that 's when in an unexpected turn of events Ramen approaches the scene and watches in horror as Eugene is being pushed towards the ground Eugene looks at him and wonders what this blubbering fool is doing here as he knocked him out specifically so that he could escape this place Raman un sheathes his sword and demands the Beast to get away from the young Master with no other choice the undead throws Eugene into a nearby wall this allows Raman to charge in using sword soul but the moment the sword makes contact with the Demonic barrier it shatters into hundreds of pieces leaving Raman defenseless and at the Undead 's Mercy he tells Eugene to run while he tries his best to keep him in place for as long as possible Eugene smiles and asks what he 's going to do as that Undead has him firmly in his grasp Raman is surprised that he can so casually laugh in a situation so dire but it shows that he is truly an amazing man and an even better person the undead seeing him smile is enraged so he throws the lowly Raman at him which makes Eugene crash into a wall once again something he now probably has to get used to at this point Raman helps him get up and notes once again that he will make an opportunity for him to get away so he should do so when he does Eugene tells him that there is no need for that as there is a door right behind them one that might hold something important the undead explains that the door can not be opened as he tried but nobody can Eugene says that what he just said makes him want to open it even more and thinks that if he has to use ignition he will but first he needs to check what is Behind These doors this is Hamill 's grave and he is Hamill in Soul at least if sea or perhaps someone else intended for this Reincarnation of his then this door that can not be opened is meant for the owner of the Grave naturally sure enough the door slowly opens and before the undead can react it sucks both Ramen and Eugene in and immediately closes Raman tries to analyze the room but Eugene immediately knocks him out which to him is a mercy as he could have just killed him because of how annoying he is that 's when he notices something that makes his eyes widen and wonders why that vermouth bastard left the sword here 300 years ago while on their quest in helmod near the demon king of Slaughter 's Castle after the party decisively won against him they were looking for any remaining subordinates and ended up finding a Stairway that led underground deep within they find ancient relics which could not be analyzed as they were extremely ancient even senia could n't fully analyze them and could only assume that he was from the age of myth however in the innermost location they found the ever so powerful Moonlight sword at first Hamill was the one to try and pick it up as he broke a lot of weapons while fighting the Demon King of Slaughter so he needed new Weaponry unfortunately for him however he could n't take the sword because as soon as he approached it he fell to his knees and immediately started to spew blood in the end the sword came into the possession of vermouth but he wonders now leaving this sword here is it some type of condolences for him this is nothing to scoff at that 's for sure the Moonlight sword sure has a simple name but it does the job and it fits quite nicely when vermouth got a hold of this sword he no longer used the sacred sword but that was a given the Moonlight sword even with its rather simplistic appearance was much much stronger than the sacred sword Eugene stares at the moon symbol above it when they first saw the Moonlight sword that symbol was a full moon beautifully bright but now it 's a crescent moon Perhaps it is in a weakened State Eugene tries to find the fragment he has thinking that it might react to the sword but that 's when he remembers that he bashed the chest of the undead earlier and never managed to get it back this makes him wonder why vermouth left the sword here perhaps because he wanted it that idiotic bastard what would be the point of giving it to him after he died well this is no time to get all sentimental as in this room there is only the moonlight sword so if he leaves this this place he has to fight that creature once again which is quite an insane Venture however the undead is n't his only problem as Amelia mwin could return at any moment so he needs to quickly get rid of the undead and bolt out of this place as fast as he can he approaches the Moonlight sword slowly and notes that he does n't know what kind of idea vermouth had to put the sword in his resting place but realistically there is only one reason it is here to let him finally have it right in his past life as haml he could n't hope to touch this sword but he reincarnated as a descendant of vermouth so it might be enough to hold it even if he ca n't he has to as vermouth gave it to him he reaches for the sword slowly but he just barely touches the light\",\n",
       " \"that emanates from it and his lungs start to feel heavy and his Mana is screaming at him to get out of this place with no other option he uses the White Flame method to reach even further to it Eugene thinks that it is incomparable to what he first tried to grab in his past life so the story about the sword shattering into pieces was true eventually he manages to grab the sword but he gets pushed backwards almost instantly with the sword still in his hand Eugene is glad that he actually managed to get it this time and gets up as he has to remove its sheath when he does he is disappointed but not surprised as he finds no blade attached to the hilt because the sword broke into pieces that 's when the Crescent Moon that was standing above it shatters into pieces and slowly the pieces form a blade for the Moonlight sword which now emanates a familiar blue glow Eugene is very happy about this and looks at the sword with a proud expression he thinks that the Moonlight sword is one that scatters all magic and Mana around it but it is swallowing up tons of his Mana like he has been starving is it perhaps resonating with the White Flame method additionally due to the amount of Mana this sword consumes he ca n't use it at the moment but he certainly has enough Mana for it after he rests he puts it in his cloak and notes that this sword is lowly but also extremely nice as even after it broke into a thousand pieces it is still powerful with this new weapon he wo n't need to use ignition he will be able to slay the death knight with ease now one last thing he has to do before leaving the room is check the casket he does so and sure enough there is no body in sight but he finds something else some writing on the casket perhaps one day they will met once again the world that they have both hoped for Eugene recognizes this as senya 's handwriting but that 's when a bright green leaf forms in his eye and his expression widens outside of the room the undead thinks that he tried to break that door countless of times with countless ways but he could not put a scratch on it even his Great Master could not do so that man however easily opened it so he can not kill him but keep him alive until his master comes back at least his helmet has shattered into pieces and his breastplate is gone he also took out his claws something which his master explicitly told him to not do so she will be filled with rage once she finds out he needs to prove himself useful to her lest he be cast out and Damned for eternity suddenly Eugene comes out of the room and asks the undead if he waited long for him the undead immediately asks him how got in there but Eugene says that he just did simple as that the undead once again asks him something what he saw inside but Eugene hushes him up noting that it 's a secret one he will never tell this makes the undead unleash his claws once again and Rush towards Eugene who is now prepared as he has the Moonlight sword by his side both the undead and Eugene look at each other and Eugene dispels his demonic claws instantly with just a swing of the Moonlight sword this makes the undead back off instantly and he seems quite puzzled L by what just happened his claws that are made from demonic energy should be unbreakable so what did this child do Eugene 's head falls down while he 's holding the sword and he thinks that he tried to control the strength of the Swing but even with that after one measly swing he is out of breath and his vision has become blurry additionally this bastardly sword is also eating his Mana constantly however he has to admit that its force is very satisfying as he could n't hit the undead but but he got his demonic Force pretty good the undead snarls at him and comes at him while stretching his whole body Eugene notices that he is n't using the Demonic Force anymore and is probably planning to just fight with his fists only something that is not wise at all Eugene pulls out wined and that 's when the undead jumps into action moving extremely Swift in 10 places at once presumably trying to take Eugene by surprise eventually he musters the courage to attack but Eugene notices him and the undead barely has time time to get out of the way Eugene notes that he is way too scared as he has n't even swung well yet he uses this opportunity to use winned and engulfs the undead into a small tornado and throws him into the wall Eugene is not finished however as he uses the Mana he has to pick up some Stone fragments and throws them at him constantly Eugene says that if he was in a better physical state he would have beaten him to a pulp until nothing remained but now he frankly does n't have the time or energy he smashes the ground with his foot and creates a large magical hand which instantly rushes to grab the undead he manages to dodge but not before the hand Taps him on the shoulder which destroys his armor he notices and he seems to have had enough as he unleashes a mighty scream and summons a different kind of demonic energy one much more red and vicious Eugene looks at this and tells him that he should have used this earlier as then he would have saved energy the magical hand comes back around and tries to grab him once again but the undead deflects it just before it can grab him however this is n't the end of the attacks as Eugene gets in front of him and just before the undead can unleash his mighty attack the Moonlight sword fragment is thrown at one of his hands Eugene Smiles as since he has the Moonlight sword in his hand he can control the fragment however he wants to this gives him but a moment to act but that 's already plenty enough for him the undead notices that he 's aiming for his core and tries to attack him but Eugene moves FAS and Deals a great blow to his chest something which sends him backwards with this the undead has been defeated but Eugene is n't in a good State either as he instantly starts vomiting blood on the ground he thinks that he used as little power as possible for this guy but still he has used way too much Mana for a normal person however this is much better than using ignition additionally now that he has no Mana left the Moonlight sword is gone for now at least he puts it in his cloak and approaches the undead dead seeing that still the core did not fully break which means that the undead is n't quite dead yet Eugene Gnarls and feels very shitty about the whole situation as this this is just an insult to the dead that Scamp really dared to break into his own grave and make a death knight out of his body no matter he needs to destroy the core take Raman and just get out while he can before the sword can fully reach the core however Eugene is Frozen in place as he ca n't move almost as if an invisible power is tying him down he smiles as he knows who has just arrived Amelia Merwin herself she stands behind Eugene who ca n't move a single muscle on his body and can only use his mouth to speak he is sure that he is able to speak only because she allowed it he asks to talk face to face at least but she notes that now she 's just wondering what to do with him she does have a few good ideas but her favorite must be this one she will be dragging him to the surface and throwing him into the hot arid sand sand naturally that could n't possibly kill him so she will make sure that his head is above the surface so that he is able to take air into those lungs of his after that she will force his eyes and mouth to stay open and due to the dry and hot area his eyes will crack into pieces and his tongue will become like dried up wood after he has experienced that he will become a scarecrow of the\",\n",
       " \"desert as she will destroy his legs and twist them into one long string additionally she will stick a few thin metal pieces into each each of his fingers something which might be too painful for someone like him suddenly Eugene 's body moves on his own and he gets up Amelia continues front the tips of his fingers into his arms across his broad shoulders and his other fingers so that he can keep his arms spread open like a good scarecrow should his eyes will already be broken by then so he will not be able to see what is happening around him but he will be able to feel it that aching pain the metal slowly becoming a part of him unfortunately for him she wo n't be able to dull his pain but at this point she would n't want to Eugene says that he will die from the shock by that point but Amelia tells him that he wo n't as she wo n't let him that is how he is going to become a scarecrow for this part of the desert for a very very long while until she is tired of seeing him like that at least finally she asks if he knows who she is and Eugene answers she is Amelia mwin Amelia notes that he is correct she is the desert 's dungeon master the Black Thorn the death answer that is her in her entirety she notices that he managed to break her pet granted it was a rather useless being but it was still hers and only she can do whatever she wants to it since she is the owner be it Torture breaking or killing it Eugene notes that she has a rather gross and ugly pet why did n't she bathe it at least Amelia smacks him across the head with her staff instantly something which sends him back she tells him that the only person who can say those things about her pet is only herself as she is the owner Eugene spits out some blood but gets up on his own as the Spells seemed to be broken so he might have a chance at an attack he ca n't delude himself like this however as Amelia is on a whole another level and he could n't hope to kill her even if he has time to use ignition he did not want to use Balzac 's letter but now he does n't have much of a Choice he asks if she knows about Balzac lbth which makes her stare at him with an inquisitive stare she does but she does n't seem to know why he is bringing up his name so suddenly Eugene explains that he knows him personally and he wrote him a letter to give to her if he were to ever come across her he throws the letter into one of her hands and she notices that indeed he is speaking the truth as this seal is BAC but why would he write a letter for someone as puny as him does he even know what this letter means Eugene says that ballzack told him if he hands this to her she would let him go no matter what he did Amelia explains that it 's a little bit different from that as long time ago bzac helped her with something as payment she promised to him a single favor no matter what it be that was a very valuable payment even for someone as powerful as Balzac as the ability to ask Amelia mwin herself for a favor is something that happens too rarely however for entire decades he did not ask her for a single thing so he gets what she 's insinuating right since he has this he now owns the favor and can ask for one thing in Balzac 's dead as long as she can do it it will be done if he does not want to die then he should ask to be spared as she will not kill him but she also wo n't let him go like this she needs to know exactly why how and what he was doing in this place Eugene seems to think for a bit and finally comes to a conclusion he asks her the mighty Amelia Merwin to off herself right in front of him and right now this makes Amelia Smile as she previously told him that it would be anything as long as she can do it and that she can not do since it has come to this she will be giving him two choices if he does n't want to talk at all she will respect his decision and will kill him however if he wants to live then she will let him but he needs to tell her about everything that she wants to know these two choices surprise Eugene and she explains that he should n't worry as she is not going to [ __ ] him like she originally planned and even if he chooses death she wo n't torture him has she plenty of ways to get him to talk he has become an interesting subject for her how did he get here a place that not even the Sultan of this desert knows about only the desert Mages here know of this place so perhaps there was a rat amongst them who worked with him that should n't have happened but it does n't matter now Eugene wonders what to do as if he asks for his life she will get a confession out of him no matter how he puts it if she does n't need to torture him for answers she will use dark magic to get her answers and at her level he ca n't hope to resist against it Amelia notes that he is thinking for a long time so should she interpret this hesitation as his answer Eugene thinks that another option is to use ignition and try to run but she will most likely use the binding once again so that 's not a good plan she says that she has become bored of waiting so she will give him to the count of three that will be the allotted time to answer one Eugene wonders if he should tell her about him being a lion heart but this [ __ ] dark Mage would n't even respect that name two should he just be honest about all of it tell her that he opened the door she could n't and found the Moonlight sword within but that 's not great either as even if she will spare his life she will certainly take his sword before Amelia can count to three she stops and looks behind her as the undead has risen Eugene notices that he has an entirely different aura that disgusting feeling he knows it all too well Amelia instantly bows down and she asks what brings the mighty and benevolent demon king of incarceration in this most disgusting place he looks directly into Eugene 's Direction and explains that he saw him through the eyes of Balzac before did he perhaps come to offer flowers to one of his ancestors dearest friends he is sure that he can see for himself that the owner of this grave is Hamil dinus who was called the foolish but he was definitely not that he was a strong and talented Warrior and also vermouths best friend Eugene wonders what the hell he is talking about but he 's also annoyed that this thing is talking about vermouth so casually the demon king of incarceration notes that he knows all to well why he would consider him an enemy but he and vermouth have genuinely understood each other and built a real relationship however to enforce something that happened 300 years ago on a descendant is rather silly of him he respects the lion hearts out of the friendship he had with the great vermouth but he will not demand respect from him now he speaks directly to him after vermouth for 300 years he has seen a ton of lion hearts come and go but he believes that he is the only one out of all of those that is most like vermouth Amilia analyzes Eugene and sure enough he seems to be a lion heart as he has all of the traits she also notes that she did n't expect to see the great king in such a pitiful place in the vessel of a puny death knight so he should tell her already how is she supposed to take all of this into account the demon king of incarceration notes that it 's up to her but she then asks did he only come here to defend the Cub of that bad lion the demon king of incarceration\",\n",
       " \"notes that it is his friend 's descendant so he had to Amelia says that this is no reason to oppress her freedoms which he is supposed to respect fully the demon king of incarceration explains that vermouth is dead has been for a long time but his bloodline continues to live on and especially this Eugene fellow as he can see vermouth in him she should not take this the wrong way as he still endear and respects her but not as much as the great vermouth Amelia asks how he can respect someone who has been dead for so long more than someone who is alive right now now she tries to get up but the Demon King pushes her down instantly which takes her by surprise she looks at him with a rage fueled expression and the demon king of incarceration says that her Freedom can not possible transcend her respect for him previously he has respected her freedom to do whatever she wishes to in Hamill 's grave and he still does but if she truly wishes to harm vermouths descendant he can not accept that for now at least Eugene notices what he just just said and asks what does he mean by for now Amelia tells him to be more polite to the great king as his arrogance is showing the demon king of incarceration explains that 300 years ago he made a promise with vermouth as he knows and 300 years is a long time for humans for all of those years he has shown courtesy and generosity to vermouths descendants he accepted it as fact that they did not show him the same kind of generosity and respect however he can not have people think that it is an obligation to be nice to them he is the demon king of incarceration ruler of countless demons and helmet 's King Eugene starts shaking uncontrollably as even this talking is making him tremble and his heart tightens in his chest The Demon King continues naturally with freedom comes a sense of responsibility as without it freedom is just self-indulgence something which he is not keen of so by his command he will relay what he is saying not to all the the lion Hearts if they will not muster enough courage to respect him he will no longer be giving them the respect he has up until now Eugene sees clear as day that this is a warning and asks why is he telling him this now after 300 years of Silence the demon king of incarceration explains that his ancestor made a promise but the payment was freedom however that promise is coming to a close the wheel that vermouth has stopped for so long is about to begin turning once again there will be a need for another promise one day so who will be able to make that promise in vermouth dead and stops that wheel from turning once again Eugene asks what the promise was and the Demon King looks at him for a second before grinning widely he does not have the right to know that since he is not vermouth but only a foolish lion his existence or rather his very Soul all of this was because of vermouths promise that he could be born 300 years later Eugene is extremely shocked by this Revelation and his pendant glows the demon king of incarceration also tells Amelia to go back to her dungeon but she does n't want to as she still has questions for this lion cub he notes that she will not find any answers from him but she does n't want to believe it as her pet was basically destroyed and he also easily opened the door that she tried to but no matter what she could n't he looks around for a door and teleports the three of them to it with one flick of his hand he disintegrates the door and tells her to look there is only hamel 's grave inside nothing ever happened here Amelia knows all to well that now he just basically told her to stand down or else Amelia asks if he likes the vessel he is wearing now as she will give it to him if he does the demon king of incarceration notes that his business around these parts is done so he will be returning Hamill 's body she asks if he 's sure as that is the body of vermouth his best friend actually the demon king of incarceration says that indeed it is but Hamill is not his friend in that moment the body slowly Falls as the Demon King removes his presence from it while getting up Amelia tells Eugene that he got very lucky but next time he wo n't she gets the essence from the body of Hamill and walks away thinking that she ca n't do anything to that brat now but someday soon she will make sure to kill him once that promise is over and in truth she just ca n't wait for it after she has gone from that area Eugene 's fist shakes uncontrollably as his veins pop out from Rage he unleashes a mighty scream and starts smashing every wall and pillar he is in visual contact with he remembers how the demon king of incarceration called him a foolish lion he knows that [ __ ] knows that he was reincarnated he also remembers what he said about him reincarnating that it was because of vermouths promise but just what could that mean did vermouth make the promise in order to to have him reincarnated that would n't be possible however as vermouth knew him all to well and if he wanted to do something for him he would have chosen to kill this damn demon king of incarceration additionally from what he gathered the promise was made for peace and it had nothing to do with The Reincarnation lastly he remembers how he said that Hamill is n't his friend but the feeling is more than Mutual at this point Amelia took his old body away unfortunately he was not able to fully annihilate it also what did that Demon King bastard imply about the wheel and how it will soon start to turn again he always speaks and riddles like some type of wise being but he does n't intend to make any promise to stop that wheel if that wheel only rolls over manure in mud it should be destroyed not stopped however if his reincarnation was n't senya 's or Ana 's doing but vermouths he 's quite surprised he did n't expect him to do something like that at all as he did n't seem the type he pulls out a leaf from his cloak and starts to piece the story together some 200 years earlier after vermouth was long dead someone invaded his grave and seya realized so she came all of the way here to stop that person seya fought that Invader valiantly but soon after disappeared this leaf that he found in front of Hamill 's coffin is something he recognizes as it is from the world tree one of these leaves allows a person to teleport to the Elven Fortress no matter where they are did she use this because she was in so much danger but who could actually Corner the great seya like that the only person he can think of is vermouth but if it was really vermouth who fought with her what would really be the reason for it he remembers the first time he met the party seya scoffed and complained at him noting that he was just some everyday mercenary anise instantly insulted him saying that he looks like he has no sense of real class and she is sure that there are more Valiant people than him [ __ ] of course was a [ __ ] so he only said that he wanted to fight the Warriors from this Kingdom as they seemed strong even after all of this though vermouth insisted that Hamill became His companion something which Hamill rejected he does n't intend to bow down to someone weaker so they will fight now unexpectedly Hamill fell in a few short minutes but he did not falter and they fought again and again until the sun was about to set eventually Hamill asked why does he even want him to come vermouth explained that he will be His companion if he wins so he has won was n't that the promise Hamill said that he does n't get it if he is the warrior of light somebody who is destined to save the world why does he need him specifically vermouth approaches him and told him that he needs him and his power in order to destroy all of the demon Kings so\",\n",
       " \"he should come with him and become a savior of this world Eugene thinks about it further if the reincarnation and the necklace were vermouth 's doing he would have been able to place the necklace in the lionart treasury with ease as he was the founder of the family but it 's too early to confidently say that this is what happened the illusion of senya he saw and the handwritten words on his gravestone those must also mean something perhaps one day we will meet in the world you hoped for that was written and if it was n't referring to heaven but his reincarnation did vermouth betray seya for some reason he does n't know and honestly does n't even want to think that this is true but in order to find out what happened what really went on in this place he needs to find senya much later the kajian of Amir stares at Eugene and hopes that at least he knows that what he is asking is too much he heard about him from his subordinates the ones who retreated but does he truly think that he sent them out to steal from him Eugene notes that he could give less about their intentions the truth is that they harm armed him or attempted to at least the kajian explains that all of this was to protect him and only that if he is not aware already nahama and Keel are not on great terms not at all as ke 's Emperor is scared about nama 's power and the sultan also holds resentment against Keel too he thinks that the Mages of the desert who are constantly progressing this damn desertification are hiding at the very end of the desert if this child somehow was able to come across them then the Scorpion would have come there too the kajian notes that him protecting him so well is basically nahama bowing down to Keel at least for once he also had to figure out what he was doing there but truly why was he heading towards the barren kajitani desert where nobody lives Eugene says that he did not come all this way to be interrogated by him and the kajian notes that this is precisely why he ca n't hope to start interrogating someone like him so he had his subordinates follow him so that they could protect him if something were to occur if Raman had properly carried out the orders he had been given they would not be having this awfully awkward conversation right now he understands that he feels bad about this situation but from what he has gathered from the others they kept a pretty good distance from him yet he was the one that attacked Eugene smiles and thinks that this guy is n't bringing up the Assassins or the desert Mages to boot so he does n't know that Hamill 's grave and Amelia mwin are in the kajani desert what a puppet however there is no need to tell him all of this so he will just solve this as he does and back off he notes that if he is right then he misunderstood the situation which is his fault but that does n't explain the whole situation to his family what will they say when they see him like this the kajian does n't know what he is trying to tell him and Eugene clarifies even if somehow all of this was just a simple misunderstanding it is true that he has endangered him so if he explains all of this as a misunderstanding he does n't know what his family will do the kajit Tan 's voice starts to tremble and Eugene explains that he does n't want this to become a bad situation either as it could lead to a problem between two entire nations and he does n't want to put his dear family in a tough situation only because of this the kajian finally gets it and asks what or how much he wants Eugene asks for a simple 500 million sell he thinks that this is a pretty cheap price for repairing their relationship which is filled with misunderstandings the kajian notes that for someone so young he sure is very bold which is not a bad trait at all he will have the money if that is the only way to appease his anger since they have settled this amicably he has to ask just one more thing before he goes truly what did he see in the kajani desert Eugene says that there was only desert and more desert as he said previously there is nothing there he thinks that the coffin statue and Memorial Stone all of them he put in his cape so really there is nothing left remaining even the Sultan of this place does n't know about Hamill 's grave so as long as that damn Amelia keeps her mouth shut tight what happened there remains there and will never get out he also tells the kajian that he will be taking Raman with him as he has to make him pay for threatening his life the kajian says that if he wants to do that he can make him easy for him and have him executed right here and right now Raman feels betrayed bet trade as this is the master that he has followed through tick and thin Eugene explains that he is not that merciless and does n't want to see his head roll over something so trivial he is just going to bring him back home and make him scrub their toilets or something the kajian says that it 's as he wants it to be and so their conversation ends while walking to his next location Eugene remembers a conversation he had with anise in a field filled with dead soldiers she said that sometimes in times like these she she has doubts if their Mighty God truly is omnipotent and all knowing as it is told then why does he let these young soldiers of him bleed like this Hamill told her to stop as it is clear as day that she is drunk anise continues however if God truly is a light that chases away all of the darkness then why does n't he do just that that 's when Hamill noted that they have vermouth he does not know anything about her God of light or complicated stuff like that but he does know that vermouth is one strong guy so if she wants to look at it like this God could not take care of this world by himself and so he sent vermouth the living Miracle to help that is why he is a valiant Warrior and why the sacred sword acknowledged him instantly anise did not expect such kind words from someone like him but Hamill did n't do it out of kindness he is just really annoyed with her as he has to listen to her drunk Tales over nothing so she should hand some of that drink over instead of drinking alone like a sad drunk anise clenched her flask tight and noted that this is not alcohol but holy water that could not be given to somebody who lacks Faith like him that 's how they started bickering about it and in hindsight that was pretty fun eventually Eugene arrives at his location the sacred ground of light Hogan where Ana 's statue is located if he were to take a shop from the holy Empire Urus across the ocean he would arrive here 200 years ago anise sent a prayer right right here before starting her pilgrimage to the very end of the desert he thinks that anise came to his grave to pay respects however senya 's retirement and Ana 's pilgrimage do not overlap completely as seya retired a few years earlier then anise chose to go on a pilgrimage anise could n't have visited his grave it seems as if she had she would have definitely done something about the state that he found it in was vermouth also somehow involved in The Disappearance of anise he could not find anything important in this place so the only clue he has now is this leaf that senya left behind Raman sheepishly grabs his attention and asks if he has changed his mind about going back Eugene claims that he has n't and they are definitely going back to ke now Cayenne eagerly waits for him as he wants to see just how strong he grew in the two years that he was gone cayen looks at the portal with a certain unease and his mother notes that he seems unhappy with his brother coming back Kenne explains that he wants him to come back but he also does n't want that at the same time\",\n",
       " \"if Eugene really wants to become the patriarch he will most likely have to give up and surrender the position to him his mother says that as long as he does not back down Eugene wo n't become the patriarch he has no need to Kenne asks truly is this what is best for the lion Hearts the patriarch position should be give to the strongest amongst the family his mother notes that he is no longer a child but a grown man he can make these decisions on his own becoming the patriarch or surrendering the position it 's all his choice cayen looks at the ground and notes that this is not what she truly wishes for his mother sze as it seems she has raised him too strictly she regrets it now as she does n't want to end up like theonis she does not want her children to suffer over her greed like iode has cenne says that he is much different than that guy and his mother notes that indeed he is so now he can make the right choice what he chooses that will be the right choice and she will respect if fully additionally Eugene is now his brother so even if they are not related by blood they are still Brothers he should talk with him once he arrives as the whole succession thing can wait eventually Eugene arrives and notes that he was going to see them all back at the house anyways so why did they come out all the way here his father immediately jumps on him and Eugene says that it 's been a while and he seems to have worked out a ton as his body is very sturdy he has also grown a large beard the father rubs his eyes and notes that it 's thanks to stod Eugene remembers that guy he is gargas Father are they really close enough now for him to refer to him by his first name he also notices an ailla behind his father and bows down while apologizing as he did not see her she tells him to not be so awkward around her as they are family Eugene look looks around and notices that the patriarch is nowhere to be seen Anna Sila explains that he is at the black lion Castle because of the coming of age ritual he knows about that right Eugene remembers that the blood secession ritual which he was a part of is attended by both direct and indirect lineages however the coming of age ritual is only for the direct lineage children an ailla notes that it was iode who was two years older than him that should have gone through the ritual last time but now he is basically estranged so the last ceremony was skipped due to this but now there are three children himself cayenne and seal who will become fully fleshed adults next year so that ceremony will be much more fun it seems that 's when Raman comes out from the portal too and Anna Sila asks who he is Eugene explains that he is his subordinate Raman and he is 32 years old he has personally picked him and he 's trustworthy he is not teaching him or anything but he will be working some random jobs for his sake he calls over nah who is also grown and tells her to start teaching him about cleaning the barn and tney Hall needs some and she should put him to the more strength-based tasks as he has enough nah is taken back by this and asks if that is okay as he is his subordinate after all Eugene tells her that this is exactly why he will do as he is told and also tells Raman that from now on nah is his senior Raman laments having to treat someone much younger younger than him as his senior but still all of this is for the young Master Eugene this way he will also pay him back for saving his life surely a day will come when he is needed and on that day he will risk his life for him as a true warrior should Ken grabs Eugene 's attention and notes that if he 's done they should go and talk about some things while they walked throughout the forest Cayenne strangely asks just what is he Eugene naturally does n't know how to respond to this and asks just what the hell he is talking about Ken asks if he truly is 19 like he says and Eugene notes that if he wants the truth he is actually a Reincarnation of someone very important Ken tells him to stop lying and Eugene ca n't help but laugh as even though this is the truth he does n't believe him he also asks why is he really that shocked at how powerful his brother has become Ken looks at him with a saddened expression and explains that it was 2 years they have n't seen each other for two entire Years yet it feels like he has lived 20 instead of two he tried he tried with all of his might while he was learning magic he trained the sword day in and day out and also reached three stars this way but all the while Eugene reached the fourth star already his expression sour and he tells Eugene to become the patriarch instead of him Eugene asks why the sudden change did he not want to become patriarch Ken notes that after seeing his face he can not handle it anymore how can he become the patriarch the leader of the family when he is obviously so much better than him in every aspect Eugene asks why not as he can just be the patriarch if he says that he will he has no competition Cayenne just ca n't accept something like that and Eugene suggests that they can have a duel if he wants him to have the position if he wins then he will accept any decision he makes cayen is confused by this as would n't it make more sense for him to become patriarch if he wins Eugene says that he is smarter than he expected which anger Kenne but still he should become the patriarch as that position is for somebody with ambition and he also does n't want such an annoying position to drag him down if he really wants him to change his mind the only way he will he be able to do it is by force cayen size and notes that instead of a duel they should just have a proper Spar like they used to they both go to the sparring area and the servants watch in awe as kayenne is desperately trying to hit Eugene even once who is not even breaking a sweat Eugene notices that Cayenne is able to control his sword Soul quite easily and can also maintain it for a long while his Mana proficiency has become much better probably because he reached three stars somebody with as much Mana as him is probably extremely rare in this continent Kenne thinks that this is strange as he got tired too fast it is like he is swinging his sword at a rock Eugene 's sword seems to deflect his every attack but at the same time it it sends his sword where he does n't want it to be one of the servants says that it 's no use and wonders if he were to fight with everything he got while also using sword Soul could he be able to win hazar comes from behind them and notes that it is unlikely Master Eugene was strong two years ago too but now he is overwhelmingly so although Cayenne has also gotten much stronger than he was previously Eugene is taking all of those Swift attacks without moving at all Eugene sends Cayenne back with a powerful Parry which makes Cayenne asks about the technique as it deflected all of his attacks Eugene says that it 's just some regular parrying but Cayenne does n't believe it as he parried his sword Soul perfectly he did not bounce it off but rather let it slide off Eugene notes that he has some pretty good eyes and cayen asks for him to tell him more about it Eugene looks at him for a second and then his expression changes into an evil one really does he truly want to learn from him Cayenne remains patient while he almost breaks breaks the sword in half but Eugene says that he will teach him as if he becomes strong enough him becoming the patriarch wo n't be an issue any longer right however there are too many people around here so they should go somewhere more private they go somewhere more isolated\",\n",
       " \"and Eugene explains that no matter what he does he wo n't become stronger than him but he will accept being the patriarch if he 's strong enough is that the case Cayenne says that it is but still Eugene exclaims that there is no butt even if if he pushes that title on him he will not become the patriarch because he simply does n't want to be one cenne thinks that he offer him the position a total of three times already but he keeps rejecting he notes that if this is his choice then he ca n't argue with it he is skilled but does n't have the qualities of a patriarch and also did n't go through the proper lessons so he is not prepared he keeps yapping and yapping until Eugene kicks him in the shin as he was just spouting [ __ ] Cayenne calms down and asks when he 's going to be taught the skill right now Eugene says that he is busy so he ca n't teach him currently but he will write it down and give it to him if he trains hard enough and reads that thoroughly he will be able to learn it in no time in Mount ukas an old and rather rough mountain located south of Keel vermouth the greater of the Keel Empire gave up on his title and moved to a house in the capital but even after 300 years afterwards ukas remains lionart territory the black lion Castle is also located at the peak of said mountain and this is the place vermouth lived in the most and also where his corpse lies the different members are attending a meeting and the patriarch announces to everyone that Eugene has just returned to the main residence one of the members notes that this is very nice timing as there are only two months remaining in this year the patriarch says that if this is the case there is no need to summon him to this place but the other member tells him that he was the one who did something so unexpected a child of indirect blood was taken into the main residence that is something that has never happened throughout their history the patriarch thinks that he has seen this man ever since he was a boy but he still feels uncomfortable about him this is the oldest man in the family and also the head of the Senate called the White Lion of immortality deer 's Lionheart he says that naturally the child has proved his worth but things have been rather messy around him Carmen says that she also met that child when she went to aoth so why is it a problem that he is from an indirect family what is important here is his potential and only that doers looks at her with a powering expression and notes that even she has good enough Insight that can not represent the black lion no matter what so he will check for himself during the coming of age ceremony which he looks forward to doers explains that the entire Senate agrees that the child Eugene has tons of potential that is precisely why they permitted the current patriarch to adopt him and nurture him at the main residence however he will also become a fully-fledged adult in 2 months and that is when they will begin the process of choosing the next patriarch he also heard that he visited nahama coming back only now and the patriarch notes that he 's correct doers notes that even before that he learned magic in aoth at the red magic Tower so he must be quite talented in that subject too well he was talented enough to make the red magic Tower Master take him as his impromptu disciple and he even had a few talks with aro 's Prince from what he 's heard he then tells the patriarch directly that they are those who possess the Lion Heart name and are a pack of lions so it 's okay for the patriarch to raise his children based on what he wishes however letting a lion be raised and then leave the pack on his own just because he wants to is disrespectful to their culture and unacceptable Gillard then looks at him sternly and says directly that decision is on him to make he should not be controlled and tossed around doers notes that naturally it is so and he will respect the child 's choices but he will have to restrict his choices for the safety of the family judging by his tone though was he planning to recommend that child for the patriarch position Gillard says that if this is what he wants then he will leave him the possibility to Carmen notes that he does n't want to she just talked with seal and she said that Eugene is refusing the position outright this makes doer smile and hope that he does n't change his mind about this later Eugene gets informed by anaila that that they will both be going to the black lion Castle something which is strange as usually the Senate Elders would come here to take part of the ceremony but this time they were invited to go there instead seal herself is already there so it 's just them two that need to go there now Eugene asks when and she notes that they should leave as soon as they are ready to with that Eugene tells Cen that they should go now as he 's sure that they will have everything they need there Cen accepts and while they walk down a corridor cenne notes that he finished reading the book that he wrote for him and well it does n't seem that useful as doing all of this is simply torturing the core a lot if he follows these methods he will just pass out from the lack of Mana in his body Eugene says that this is how he trained it thinking that it 's how Hamill used to train his Mana even though he changed it a bit for Kai in order to make him even try he tells him to keep something in mind he must do it even if he thinks he ca n't he has to keep going even if he wants to cry and throw up blood that is what he must sacrifice in order to become like him and more importantly this is what he needs to do in order to become patriarch cenne is quite spooked by his words and calls him a bastard which Eugene enjoys as it means his teasing is working Ken also notes that this is the first time in a long while the Coming of Age ceremony is being held somewhere else especially at the black lion Castle however he kind of gets why as because of that sad sack of nothing I owed the Senate has been keeping an eye on them too maybe just maybe they want to teach them a lesson and most likely warn him specifically of something Eugene asks what they would do with him then and cenne explains that since he 's the future patriarch maybe they want to congratulate him a little earlier and he might even be allowed to go to vermouths grave this makes Eugene stare at him deeply as vermouths resting place is located in Mount Ulus but its precise location is extremely well hidden and even the current patriarch does not know about it he does not believe that vermouth died peacefully like the books said so he needs to make sure that it 's his body that is in that grave at least to confirm his suspicions if nothing else Cayenne starts fangirling about the things that he will be allowed to maybe a weapon that vermouth himself used the special ones among them the demon Kings of cruelty 's weapon the Demonic Spear ruos and the demon king of Slaughter 's weapon the pulverizing flail zigal these two are not kept in the treasury of the main residence but rather in the black lion Castle currently the one who owns the Demonic spear is the eldest member of the Senate and its leader doer lionhart subsequently the owner of the pulverizing flail zigal Ard is his grandson and the first Legion captain of the black lion Knight order dominant lionhart cenne says that the leader of the Senate is way too old as he 's passed even the age of retirement maybe he will retire and give the Demonic spear to him Eugene does n't care about this however as he has no way of knowing while he is in his room Eugene un sheathes the Moonlight sword and notices that his Mana gets drained the moment he pulls this thing out what an idiotic sword\",\n",
       " \"the fragment he got from the auction is also here and stays in the middle of the sword resonating with it and adding more power he thinks that once he collects all of the fragments the sword will return to its original power but he should n't hurry as he needs to find vermouths grave first and foremost also he did n't foresee leaving the main residence so soon as he still has the gigantic haml statue and gravestone shoved up his cape he was going to put them up here if he could convince Gillard but since he can not that idea is out of the question however a new idea just popped up in his mind once the two brothers meet at the gate they both ridicule each other 's dressing code but cenne keeps staring at the Cape of Darkness as he heard many things about it specifically that it can deflect spells and even has a pocket storage in it Eugene tells him that no matter how long he stares at it he will not give it to him once the portal gate to the black lion Castle is open Eugene takes the first step in and cayenne follows him when they arrive however Eugene just looks down and cayenne starts to scream for his life as they were sent directly to the air while he elegantly descends Eugene notices the black lion castle at the peak of the mountain but how are they supposed to get all of the way there anyways however this might be beneficial for him as if vermouths grave is hidden somewhere around these parts he will be able to inspect as a bit before they go to the castle he notices the screaming cayenne and thinks that if this is how the coming of age ceremony begins and it was n't a teleporting error they will probably have some SA devices set up so Cayenne wo n't die probably with that he focuses on himself and uses magic to land the Senate looks at this and doers asks their Mage if that is wiard 's power to which he replies with no that is just simple floating magic doers also notices that Eugene did n't Panic at all and he must be good with magic to pull out the right spell for the right moment he asks the Mage just how proficient he is and the Mage explains that floating magic is at the lowest fourth circle magic and even though he felt fell from a high place his speed was quite consistent and his balance was topnotch he might as well be fifth Circle or maybe more afterwards doers asks if he knows that level Eugene has reached in the White Flame method Gillard notes that before he went to aoth he was at three stars and he received a letter last year that he had reached four this makes doer laugh four stars at only 19 he might actually be even higher now since it 's been a year since then one of the senate members notes that this is impossible five stars before becoming a damn adult Carmen says that just because he 's untalented does n't mean that everyone else is n't he should n't project himself like that this makes the man mad as he feels like Madam Carmen is looking down on him right now but he 's been a part of this senate for 10 whole years Carmen tells him to not call her Madam as he looks older than her others might think he was her dad or something if they did n't know better the man explains that it 's because she uses magic to look young despite being a a fossil at this point just how long will she be keeping this up Carmen says that it 's much better to look younger than being old making him say that she has no class to speak of if she is a part of the ancient Senate she should look the part to she is over 60 but she has duded herself into looking younger Carmen snaps her cigar in two and it seems that he touched a subject he really should n't have doers notes that they have almost made it to the ground and sends Dominic for them to test them out a bit he accepts but Gillard tries to oppose this as they should test them at the castle not in the forest doer says that it would n't really be a test if they do it that way does he not believe in his children at all Gillard says that he does so doers notes that this is very different from the blood succession ritual as there is no reason to cater to their age and experience gilard tells him that if they were going to do it like that they should have invited iode here too doers finds it disappointing that he still has n't got gotten over that incident he understands that it 's his son but he needs to let him go he 's living a happy and peaceful life at his mother 's place so it 's all good Gillard notes that still he is the oldest of the main family and even he will not succeed the patriarch title he might as well be a part of this ceremony doers Taps him on the shoulder and tells him that it 's a shame it happened but unfortunately that child has already become an adult where Eugene is a two-headed ogre attacks him which he easily takes care of as its head is very exposed apparently this is the second one he fought but it 's strange as these ogres are the type to take entire forests as their territory so two being in the same region is unheard of he thinks that maybe they were raised in captivity but maybe it 's not just these ogres as the wild forest feels like a farm for Monsters also there 's no restriction put on their Mana like in the blood succession ritual so there 's no way that they just Dro them out of the sky just to fight some measly monsters he continues walking around but that 's when he feels the wind coming faster in One Direction and is glad that there will finally be some action going on suddenly a wyvern appears but it 's leashed and is being rode on by none other than seal who wonders how Eugene managed to Dodge in Time Eugene says that defeating just monsters would have been too easy but it 's been a long time since they last met does n't she think that she 's a bit too harsh to just attack him instead of greeting him nicely she asks if his head hurts and Eugene asks why it would seal explains that there is a barrier over this forest and it should be clouding his mind quite a lot Eugene notes that indeed he felt a little dizzy when he first came here but that 's it seal is surprised that that 's all that he felt but Eugene tells her that he 's pretty sturdy seal thinks that barrier is supposed to project the mind 's fear into reality as Illusions in order to break down their mind when she met Cayenne he was screaming like a maniac because of some ghost illusion Eugene thinks that he 's endured countless psychological attacks in his past life Additionally the forest barrier is n't meant to break down the mind of someone only scare them while getting off of the Dragon seal notes that originally they were going to see how he responds to his fears but instead of ambushing him early on she has no other choice but to fight him Eugene pulls out his sword too and Promises to not go easy on her with that seal charges in and Eugene deflects her with a single strike she does n't give up however and keeps jumping and attacking until Eugene catches her midair and unleashes a few magic missiles knowing full well that she ca n't Dodge midair however the wyvern Roars and with both of his wings unleashes a gust of wind strong enough to send seal flying which surprised Eugene as he did n't expect such coordination and understanding seal then gets into position as she prepares to strike him once again even when she does Eugene just Dodges and while he is in the air pulls out a whip which he ties seal with making her fall to the ground as a result he thinks that this is over but seal tells him to look behind that 's when the wyvern opens its mouth wide to bite him but he Dodges resulting in him letting go of the whip Eugene gets ready to kill this awfully\",\n",
       " \"creature but seal who is still tied up screams at him to not kill her dear wiwe Eugene is quite shocked at what he just heard and asks her to repeat herself which she does Eugene sheaths his sword but finds it quite annoying that she was the one who ambushed him first so she should n't make demands like this while the wyvern charges at him once again he tells it that today is a lucky day as he wo n't have to rid him from this world with that Eugene kicks him in the chin and jumps high into the air finishing the fight with a mighty Punch To The Head eventually seal gets free of her restraints and is quite mad that Eugene treated WWE so poorly so she charges up her sword soul and rushes in with with a mighty thrust Eugene just puts his hand forwards which makes seal wonder why he 's doing this is he really going to use his bare hands to block sword soul is he crazy without much Choice she misses deliberately which allows Eugene to grab her hand put her in Handlock and pin her to the ground seal asks him to go easier on her and Eugene agrees but only if she stops attacking him she notes that the fight was already over as she could n't have won in the first place with that Eugene lets her go and she asks if he predicted that she was going to change her trajectory like that Eugene notes that it was a coin toss a gamble he made which makes her mad as his hand could have been sent flying Eugene notes that he knew anyway that she would n't do anything to his hand which makes her call him a bastard Eugene also says that it 's a surprise to see her here but since she 's here why does n't she explain what is going on to her seal just tells him to find the black lion Castle but Eugene already knows knows that what he was asking is how this trial will work that 's when seal explains that there are a total of 60 black lion Knights including the captains that are going all over the mountain and looking for him Eugene notes that this is a bit over the top of something as simple as a Coming of Age ceremony but she notes that the Senate leader values him quite well and cayenne was just mixed up in this trial because of him Eugene still tells her that 60 people is just too much for only two people but seal notes that the mountain is quite vast and they are not all participating in the Ambush as some are positioned to stop him or cenne from going to places where they should n't Eugene thinks about this and one place immediately comes to mind vermouths grave the place he wants to go to Eugene asks what kinds of places they are n't allowed in and seal explains that it 's most likely dangerous places because this mountain has tons of monsters in it and around here there are only ogres but once he goes deeper and deeper there are countless demonic creatures who actually hunt ogres for fun Eugene is quite surprised by her statement as he did n't expect for demons to be here of all places seal notes that from what she heard at least they are raising them to increase the black lion Knight 's experience Eugene looks at her with a Stern face and explains that demons are n't dogs or cats they ca n't raise them all they did was let some demons loose in the forest vermouths grave their damn ancestor should be in this mountain but they just let demons have their fun around here seal asks why he 's getting mad at her of all people but Eugene still holds her accountable as she is also a part of the lionhart family seal did n't see him as a real Patriot of the lionhart family and explains that the demons are kept far away from vermouths grave and she 's gone for demon raids several times around here but there was nothing about that grave ever Eugene thinks that if that scile Senate leader is paying close attention to him he must change his plan as he was was going to try and locate the grave but there are too many variables for now he will go with plan B that is to just go to the black lion Castle while seal gets ready to leave Eugene tries to hitch a ride but she refuses and warns him to get as far away from this place as humanly possible since the other Knights will get to him very soon Eugene looks around to get an idea but suddenly tries to grab seal which she notices so she swiftly Dodges Eugene was expecting this so he charges up a gust of wind and sends her flying this allows him to get on top of the wyvern which tries to get him off immediately but Eugene warns him if he does n't want to get beaten within an inch of his life he better start flying with that the wyvern does just so and seal tries to get him back but Eugene tells him to ignore her as he will be dead if he does otherwise when Eugene gets high into the air he notices something quite surprising countless Knights all with their own wyverns Eugene does n't notice Carmen amongst this group and he does n't know how the other captains look but none of the guys here look strong enough to be one they all get ready to attack reminding themselves that this is just a test and Eugene thinks that the black lion Knight order is very skilled as even in his past life there was n't a knight order stronger than them however their attacks will not be made with the intention to kill so they ca n't hope to push him at all he will be the one testing them actually as he wants to see if the black lion Knight order has improved or not Eugene is the one to charge in first which surprised the knights but alas they all get ready for battle two arches try to shoot him down but he eats their arrows with the cloak spins and shoots them back which the knights react to however this gives Eugene ample opportunity to go behind one and try to strike him the Knight tries to defend himself but Eugene manages to push him off that 's when an elderly Knight charges in with a mighty spear strike and Eugene seems to know who he is Nathan lionhart the third Legion Vice Captain he saw a while back in a wroth Nathan lands on a wyvern and asks what happened with seal as she surely must have come for him before everyone Eugene notes that she 's just down there and pulls out a spear challenging Nathan 's skill it seems to have proven fruitful however as Nathan was pushed back with his own weapon no less something which he did n't believe possible suddenly Eugene rushes past him as there is no need for him to go through all of this fighting since the only thing he needs to do is reach the castle that 's when a large Boulder is thrown at him which came from below so he looks down but in that Split Second Carmen pops up behind him and kicks him to the ground with flexible movement before Eugene Falls completely to the ground he cushions his fall with a wind spell and thinks that seal told him that there would be captains included in the knights who would hunt for them so he 's not surprised that the third Legion Captain Carmen lionhardt herself is here the other Knights also fall down to the ground and Eugene asks if he is n't receiving too much attention given that there are two two contestants here Carmen explains that it 's because he 's doing much better than Cayenne who is still running from his fears even after all this time past however he should n't be mad about it as it means he will get more attention which is good she promises the test will end quickly since she 's here they will do it like this if he can survive 3 minutes of her attacks she will take him to the castle herself Eugene asks if that really is all and Carmen says that if he can achieve this there will be no need for the test to continue however if he thinks that it 's too unfair she can make it a minute Eugene sigh as he knows full well that Carmen\",\n",
       " \"is confident because he 's still a child but to hear those words from her it 's kind of annoying so Eugene does what he 's best at Mock he 's fine with anything since he 's young and fresh but would n't she be pushing herself too much at her old age moving around for 3 minutes must be hell right Carmen 's hand trembles and the other Knights watch in horror as they know what 's about to go down she notes that it will be 1 minute if he can resist for that long she will keep her promise they both charge their auras and Carmen rushes in with a mighty kick but he blocks it and tries to hit her with his sword eventually she manages to push him away but she 's quite surprised to see that he blocked all of her attacks up until now all of her attacks were supposed to break at least a few bones but this child 's reaction speed is much faster than expected if that 's the case she must take him more more seriously once again she charges in but with even greater speed Eugene remains calm and just parries the attack thus begins their exchange of blows with neither of them being able to lend a full attack on the other they continue with this for quite a while making Eugene quite impressed by her current skills at the level she is now she would have been just as renowned 300 years ago too if he considers just her Aura alone she 's on the same level as Amelia mwin but he ca n't know for sure as Amelia had something which Carmen has n't the intent to kill it 's quite a shame really as he wanted to fight her properly without holding back anything but if that was the case he would n't have been able to win even if he uses ignition she strikes his sword a few more times which is chipped to high hell and Eugene announces that 3 minutes have passed already actually it might be past that this leaves Carmen surprised as 3 minutes passed yet she did did n't land a single critical blow on this child it 's true that she was controlling her strength but she was n't able to overpower him she asks if there 's any time left and Eugene tells her that there is n't he was counting in his head Carmen asks if he really was counting while they were fighting and Eugene notes that thanks to her going easy on him this time he had plenty of energy left to spare so yes suddenly someone comes around and congratulates him on a job well done Eugene notices his weapon the pulverizing hammer zigal the weapon of the demon king of Slaughter and the current owner of such a weapon is the first Legion Captain Dominic lionhart he notes that he ca n't believe such a talented fellow is only 19 he always heard from others that he was quite skilled but he thought they were only exaggerated rumors however it seems that the rumors were not wrong Eugene thanks him for the compliments and asks Carmen if they need to test him further as in his eyes he has already proved himself Carmen grees and so they make their way to the castle when they get ready to depart seal also arrives on her wyvern who is scared within an inch of his life and she swears at Eugene for leaving her alone like that he looks at her and she seems fine enough noting that the wivern is pretty smart if it found her so quickly this is some nice timing too as they are all going to the black lion castle and he needs to hitch a ride like right now seal is quite surprised and also anxious that Eugene wants to ride the wyvern with with her and so she accepts as she does n't mind they get in the air and they all make their way towards the castle with seal warning Eugene to stick closer as he might fall Eugene tells her that it 's fine since he wo n't die anyway seal then tells him to not hold on the ywi scales in such a way as that might hurt him Eugene says that if something like this will hurt a damn wyvern then he should just be called an oversized lizard from now on she explains that this wyvern is quite sensitive and so to please sees her Eugene puts his hands on her hips and asks if this is enough she happily agrees and that 's when she takes a detour as they might as well take a flight around before going to that dark place Eugene says that he would much rather hurry to the castle and get some food for him but she notes that the only thing he will be eating are the lectures of the elders so he should relax for a while with her eventually Eugene arrives at the black castle and walks with Carmen who explains that they do not have enough people in the black lion night order the great lionhart family has over 300 years of history and for a night order with the only purpose of it being to protect that family and its history they are far too few Eugene asks what they could do about that in the first place as unlike the main residences white lion Knight order the black lion Knight order is made out of people who are from the lionart family and only that Carmen notes that all of this is because the black lion order has to take care of the messy jobs and they ca n't get Outsiders to get mixed up in such important dealings that 's when she invites him to the black lion Knight order which he is quite surprised of but says that he already refused that offer two years ago to be exact Carmen notes that all of this was before she saw his skills but today she did and the second Legion Captain 's disciple position is still empty if he wishes to join them Eugene asks what he has been doing for the past few years as he imagined there would be more candidates but Carmen explains that he did find one but his personality was too rough and nobody could stand understand him however his skills remind her of the second Legion captain and they would fit together pretty well Eugene tells her that he never even saw the guy and she notes that if he chooses to become his disciple he would actually get along with him and additionally being in this black lionite order is a great honor Eugene says that it might as well be but he would like to prioritize his own honor hearing this Carmen decides to tell him that the Senate is quite weary of him as the situation in nahama was quite suspicious from every angle but he went and visited that empty place without any words Eugene asks if she really thinks that he planned something with the nahama people and Carmen says that she does n't as the possibility is quite low but they simply can not ignore it since nobody imagined that IOD would get into dark magic but he knows full well what happened he 's in a very good position and thus will receive tons of generous offers he is also talented beyond belief but there is a limit of his authority because he comes from a lower class bloodline what if somebody offered him help in getting the patriarch position Eugene puts it bluntly he never wanted to become the patriarch but Carmen continues he should think about it differently then because of his skills everyone will try to take him on to their side did nahama Sultan promise him wealth and fame perhaps Eugene asks if this is an interrogation which she says it is Eugene will not answer any further questions as he is sure the people in this room will ask him plenty of questions when she opens the door Eugene sees the most important people in the lionart family doers the patriarch kleene the unspecified from an indirect bloodline Dominic and hos Eugene bows down and greets them while also presenting himself he also apologizes if this is rather sudden but he must show them something something very important the Statue and gravestone he got from Hamill 's grave Klein asks what that might be and doers gets up analyzing it quite thoroughly he notices that on the grave Stone there 's a name Hamill dinus Gillard gets up and wonders if this really is the statue of Hamill the foolish doers asks where and how he was able to get\",\n",
       " \"such an item and Eugene explains that he found it in Hamill 's grave when he hears this H know 's eyes widen and he looks sternly at Eugene he explains that as they all know he has studied in a Roth for two entire years in the Royal Library Rion in saa 's Hall to be exact he was able toar learn about Hamill 's grave through witchcraft doer asks how and Eugene notes that this is the very first time someone from their family has gotten to look into witchcraft so he assumes that senya meant for one of them to find it Hamill is an old friend of vermouth their ancestor and unlike the other ones he was not able to return as he sacrificed himself for the sake of the world and his friends Eugene feels embarrassed after saying something so cringy but continues and says that he walked through the Nama desert and found sir Hamill 's grave it was n't in pristine condition though in fact it was the opposite as the only things that remained intact are right here the statue and the gravestone he was n't alone however as there was also a death knight made from Hamill 's corpse and he was able to defeat it but he also came across the terrifying dungeon master of the desert Amelia Merwin the Mage is shocked that he met her and most importantly that he came out alive Eugene explains that he is alive right now because the demon king of incarceration appeared everyone is shocked at this Revelation and Eugene notes that he stopped Amelia from butchering him but also gave him a warning that he is supposed to pass on to the others he told him that freedom without responsibility is self-indulgent and that his Good Will and silence will not last for long deer 's eyes widen and Eugene thinks that he needed to do this as he does n't know what vermouth promised but having heard this warning they need to prepare for the peace to end he additionally tells them the other things The Demon King said that he can not have people thinking that he is obligated to be nice to them and if they will not respect him he will not do that either from now on doers sits down as they have never expected for him to bring such dire news at first they were going to interrogate him about what he was doing in the desert but now they have much bigger problems Klein says that the Demon King still wishes for peace and if they do n't insult him any longer there should still be peace Gillard tells him otherwise as if he needs to warn them he is sure that the peace will end eventually nahama has been invading tath for hundreds of years and if helmod was behind all of this they can bet that the demon king of incarceration was somehow involved too doers asks if he will go to the demon king and ask if he really was involved he also half expected this to happen as the two strongest demon kings are still alive and kicking their subordinates are also spread around everywhere their hero vermouth took only four Companions and took down the demon king of Cruelty Slaughter and frenzy however he was n't able to defeat the demon king of incarceration and of Ruin if they really go to war who will be able to defeat the demon Kings now himself or his grandson Dominic will he do it Gillard notes that this is n't a threat to them only as the demon king of incarceration is surely after the entire world doer says that even if it is like this they are descendants of their natural enemy so they will be in the front lines should something happen he asks Gillard if he thinks that they are ready for something like this to occur Klein notes that nobody from their families be it Keel or lionhearts that are disrespecting The Demon King it 's the holy Empire and the Allied powers of devil Conquest who kept their armies on standby just at the borders of helmed those damn haters will invade helmet the second they hear about this do n't ERS tells him to relax as even though they are doing something like this it 's just a show of power and if things get serious he is sure they will recall their armies Eugene thinks that this is a slow discussion but it 's fine as he will not have to worry about them declaring war on helmet not that he cares either way as he wants to kill the demon Kings as much as all of them doers asks what he intends to do with the items he got and Eugene explains that he was thinking of putting them where their ancestor rests how grave has already been fully destroyed but they should read this doers does just that and reads all of the insults piece of [ __ ] garbage human and the numerous others Eugene tells him to read the part below it about how great he was and that everyone will miss him Eugene notes that their ancestor really mourned his death and he thinks it 's only fair that they put the statue in gravestone where he lays so that they may rest together he did not learn magic from the great senya but his mentor was roarian who had inherited her tradition and he is sure that he can confidently call himself a mentee of her so he is both Sea 's mentee and their ancestors descendant also the last person to pay respect to the great haml so he proposes that he should be the one to bring all of these feelings and items to the ancestors grave doers understands him but is still rather reluctant as it 's not easy to get it Gillard pushes him to let him as Hamill deserves at least this and Carmen also feels it 's only fair that Eugene go there and place them since he was the one to bring them with that doers accepts and Eugene smiles widely finally he will be able to go there he will not be able to open up his coffin or search further but he can memorize the location and just go there again doers explains that they will need time to open the path so he can keep the items for now Eugene agrees and wonders what kind of path he will be opening doers orders zenos to bring Eugene to his room and also tells Gillard to postpone his reunion with his Sons for a little bit as they have a lot to discuss while Eugene is escorted he thinks about zenos and his very weird personality as every disciple he had simply ran away after a while zenos tells him that they should go somewhere private as he needs to see that statue and gravestone once again Eugene asks why he would want to see them again and with teary eyes zenos explains that he simply wants to give flowers and pay his respects Eugene asks why in the hell he 's crying so hard but zenos excuses this as this being his conjunctivitis which makes tears flow sometimes even if he does n't want them to Eugene is rightly weirded out by this and now understands why his disciples all ran away Eugene does what zenos asked him to do and ca n't help but wonder why this guy is giving flowers and sobbing for a person he never even met is he a descendant or something if that were the case his descendant would have married vermouths descendant and had children but that 's not possible as he has never had kids ever without any straight answer he asks zenos himself if he has some sort of connection with Hamill he slowly gets up and announces that he is Hamill 's Disciple This shocks Eugene as he has never had a disciple in his past life he did n't have the opportunity to have one zenos then explains that technically he did not learn directly from him but like all of the branch families out there his family split off from the main family his distant ancestor was vermouths Second Son the older son became the patriarch after vermouth and many of the other siblings had left the main residence to start an indirect lineage his ancestor did not become patriarch but he was able to inherit something other than the White Flame method the main family uses that would be Hamill 's techniques as vermouth taught them to his ancestors Eugene 's interest has now peaked and zenos asks him about something important did he by any chance find his secret technique next to the Grave\",\n",
       " \"zenos notes that he saw the duel between him and Carmen the way he deflected her attacks was similar to one of Hamill 's techniques that his family inherited that type of skill can not be simply imitated without genius and great combat sense also one would need understanding and control over their Mana however if he found some of Hamill 's secret text inside of the Grave it 's not entirely impossible Eugene is kind of mad that vermouth just up and decided to teach his descendants about his skills and asks why vermouth taught his second son Hamill 's techniques and not his zenos explains that after vermouths oldest became patriarch many Branch family started to form and as the family continued to grow the black sheep started to stand out more and more his ancestor was the first black lion who convicted those people and Damned them Eugene now understands better vermouth decided to train his second son as a loyal dog who would keep the main family and other Branch families in check if he taught him his techniques though it must mean that he considered his techniques powerful enough to stand up against the main family ones zenos asks once again if he possesses any of Hamill 's text then he would like to have it as it is a part of his Heritage Eugene sigh and says that they should go over their positions first and foremost if they go with technicalities he is Hamill 's direct disciple so is he not above him regarding seniority zenos is quite puzzled by this but Eugene explains that he would be his senior brother with him being the junior although he was born decades earlier than he was if he truly wants to call himself Hamill 's disciple he must treat him as a senior his older brother zenos thinks about this and asks if this means that there was a secret text from Hamill in his grave Eugene confirms his suspicions but unfortunately he memorized it and burned it he must have heard earlier that a death knight attacked him so he could not bring it with him however if he treats him as his senior brother then he can compare the technique of Hamill to the ones he learned from his family and teach him what he is missing the cards are on the table zenos asks if he really has the techniques memorized fully which angers Eugene as this is reminding him of how Amelia kept talking and asking dumb questions zenos then asks if he has to call him his senior brother in front of other people too Eugene explains that something of that nature would inconvenience the both of them as they would have to explain a lot of stuff so he will only be made to call him senior brother behind closed doors zenos accepts the offer and calls him senior brother Eugene says that since everything is settled they should go to his room as he is tired from all of the stuff he had to do today they do just that and at a table zenos explains that vermouth taught his second son 10 techniques in total Eugene wonders if he had that many as he only named one of the skills ignition the rest he just used depending on the situation he asks zenos to describe them and and he does just that the first haml method is called Ignition Eugene asks him to stop instantly and asks if vermouth named all of these himself zenos is not certain but that 's how they always learn them Eugene is quite mad now as this name is straight dookie could n't he have thought of a better name he reluctantly asks zenos to continue and he obliges there is ignition monop parrying thousand Thunders lightning counter assura Rampage Dragon burst cyclone dead end destructive Divine key and the Eternal Purgatory after hearing all of these names he starts to remember the memories he had erased because he did not want to think about them at all the memories of when he named his techniques for example Aura Rampage which was just him swinging his swords around with extreme force seya recognized this as what it is but Hamill counterattacked by saying that all she does is explode something and call it fire blast or whatever seya explained that she had to do that other otherwise the spell would n't work Hamill also got on an 's case as this goes for her too all she does is emit some light and call it the Holy Cross or something anise told him that she at least had to shape it into a cross and asked him if his skills get stronger if he shouts the name of the skill Hamill confirmed as he needs to shout and feel stronger [ __ ] thought it was pretty cool as when he does shout it an attack it really feels like he has become the Asura Eugene is now extremely embarrassed as he was too young back then he only used these names for a couple years then erased them from memory after realizing how cringe they were but vermouth that rat bastard memorized them fully and taught them his skills vermouth was smart so he must have memorized them quite quickly and 300 years down the line these names like Eternal Purgatory are being screamed into the heavens this makes Eugene rise to the higher echelons of cringe where no man should be he never expected for those dumb names to be passed down three entire centuries later and especially in the lionhart family he should have just regressed instead of reincarnating and killed his past self with his own two hands zenos asks if these names were written in the hidden text he burned and Eugene explains that the book he found did not have these cringe names so those skill names must be the one haml made when he was still quite immature zenos is quite hurt by this as he may be his senior brother but he will not stand by while he looks down on these skills that their ancestors worked hard to achieve Eugene says that he is misunderstanding it 's not about the skills it 's about their names he should put his hand on his chest and be honest here thousand Thunders dead end Aura Rampage are n't these names even a little embarrassing zenos thinks about it and notes that Carmen 's ultimate attack is called Destiny breaker so it seems that making cringe names runs in the family Eugene pulls out a feather and paper noting that he should write in detail about these skills and he will compare them to the text in his head so that he can fix any wrong parts for him while zenos does that Eugene asks him if he ever entered their ancestors Graves zenos confirms that he did but only once when he became captain and it was n't just him anyone who is appointed captain gets the chance to visit vermouths grave and swear on their life to continue protecting the family Eugene then asks what kind of place it is and and zenos notes that it 's nothing too expensive it 's just a very secret spot so he ca n't tell him in detail but it 's sort of a temple if he had to compare it to something perhaps vermouth transcended to a God when he passed and that 's why the temple was built to worship him Eugene Ponders on the idea and thinks that if he did actually become a God then reincarnating his best friends is not impossible but if he had acquired omnipotence then he would n't have fought seya Zenus finishes with the skill descriptions and when Eugene reads reads them he thinks that they are all a mess these dumb asses that inherited the haml method must have changed a ton of things to try and compensate Eugene sits down and explains that this is much different than what he saw he erases the haml method text from the paper which makes zenos ask why but Eugene tells him to be quiet as it does n't concern him he should keep in mind however these techniques are not really that great to have their own name being restricted to only these techniques will only damage them in the long run as it will block their growth he should stay far away from the haml method as well zenos knows he 's right but ca n't help but Wonder did he already Master the haml method perfectly Eugene notes that he 's editing this paper now so yes he has zenos excuses his rudeness but he wants to know how much of the Hamill method he understands Eugene gets up and tells him to observe\",\n",
       " \"closely he then gathers up mana at the tip of his blade and unleashes it in a small and controlled explosion zenos notices is that this is the Eternal Purgatory skill and it was cast with ease this time as this technique is famous for consuming tons of Mana Eugene asks if this is enough and zenos asks him to show him the destruction Divine Chi too Eugene notes that it 's just wrapping Mana around his body he should take this already and study it however he has one condition if Carmen or anyone else tells him to take him as a disciple he should reject them zenos asks why as if someone like him were to be in the black lion Knights it would be a great honor Eugene threatens him with the paper and zenos immediately folds confirming that he will be rejecting them as fast as possible later Eugene has a meal with seal who just stares at him while he eats she then asks what he talked with zenos about all day did he perhaps decide to join the black lion Knights Eugene notes that he did n't they just talked about techniques and such she also asks about how close he was with the prince of aoth and about roarian did he perhaps introduce him to a promising young Mage or something Eugene tells her to stop with the questions as she knows already he 's not the type to socialize seal explains that their brother will become quite the busy fellow starting next year and many renowned Nobles and other royal families will want to get introduced to their brother who is the successor of the lionheart family additionally the sea Kingdom siman 's young Princess and the luhar kingdom princess are both his marriage candidates he might actually be the first one to get married out of the three of them Eugene thinks that the luhar kingdom was set up by [ __ ] so he does n't even want to know what her descendant looks like just when he starts feeling bad for cayenne he arrives all tattered up and very dirty Eugene thought he would have been lost for a few more days and asks if he saw any more ghosts in the forest cayen does n't even want to think about that but thinks that he spent an entire day struggling against different Illusions and monsters but Eugene this damn bastard arrived at the castle within an hour of him descending to the woods suddenly a maid comes with an Urgent Message a guest will arrive soon so they all should get ready and come to the warp gate seal notes that she did n't hear anything about this and the maid explains that they just received the message and the visit was decided during the conference meeting between the different Elders Eugene asks who this important guest is and the maid says that it 's the auxiliary Bishop of the Holy Empire Urus Christina everyone from the family gets dressed and waits at the warp gate where eventually Christina arrives with three knights in toe Eugene is quite shocked as she looks exactly like anise she thanks them for the grandiose welcome and doers admits that he did not expect her to come all the way here she notes that she should naturally respond to any summons she gets and that they should go talk things through when they do that Eugene stares at her which makes her suddenly stop and smile in his Direction something which takes him by surprise see seal asks if they ever met before and Eugene denies this as this is his first time seeing her seal then asks why she was smiling at him like that something which Eugene can not answer as he does n't know either later while he is having some tea Eugene thinks that Christina is an adopted daughter of one of the three Cardinals of the Holy Empire and also a saintus of a long line of successors after Ana 's disappearance she is not literally a saint at the moment but she is the only candidate there is so in a few years she will surely become the saintus the maid knocks at his door and announces that there is a guest here to see him the bishop Christina he goes to meet her and they both introduce each other Eugene asks what brings her here and she explains that she received a revelation from God which makes Eugene ask what kind she does n't want to tell him however which makes Eugene wonder why he told him in the first place Christina explains that this was just to let him know this meeting was Guided by God a Additionally the meeting with the elders has ended and since the head of the Senate decided to open the doors to Hamill 's grave she will accompany him Eugene is quite puzzled by this but she says that this was her purpose for being here anyway so he lets it go while they walk the Halls Eugene notes that she is the sole candidate for the saintess position is this role passed down through bloodline perhaps Christina does n't seem to get the question and Eugene explains that he learned magic for 2 years in the Royal Library acon where Sea 's Hall resides in there paintings of her friends from 300 years ago can be found and that includes anise the faithful he does n't know how she might react to this but she looks a lot like anise eerily so Christina keeps the same monotone smile and accepts this as a compliment rather than anything Eugene thought she would have been more surprised but maybe the other priests said so as well so she might have heard this quite often she notes that he he sees the great anise in her perhaps this is another miracle from God but how much does he know about her truly Eugene says that she 's the only saintus candidate currently and also the adopted daughter of cardinal reras Christina confirms that indeed she was abandoned by her parents when she was just an infant but she 's not sad as her parents surely wanted God to look after her and abandoned her in front of the ABY thus she knows nothing of where she came from but since he says that she is similar to Anise perhaps she is her ancestor Eugene heard that she did not have any children but Christina says that she was human too perhaps she just wanted a child Eugene thinks that it 's probable anise was always a snake and very secretive despite being a saint when they get out Eugene notes that it 's cold so he hands Christina a cloak which she wears immediately Eugene then asks if they 're going to the round table but Christina says that they are n't they are going to the back of the castle as that is where the grave is while they walk on a steep hill Christina notes that he must have quite a lot of interest in the heroes of old which Eugene does n't confirm or deny she explains that Hogan is a part of the Nama territory but it is also appointed as the Holy Land of the Holy Empire every year tons of Believers choose to go there for their pilgrimage and naturally there are bound to be tons of eyes in the holy land this might come out is offensive but she knows why he was in hogi Eugene is not offended at all as he also felt tons of people stare at him in Hogan is the holy Empire watching him closely because of God 's revelation Christina still wo n't tell him since he is n't a Believer so even if it 's on his mind she informed him for that purpose only Eugene Smiles as her personality is bad and with her looks she is exactly like how anise used to be even though they all shared stories of the past anise never talked talked about hers and although she had not said it he knew very well every time someone mentioned any Cardinal of the Holy Empire the ones who raised her Ana 's usual silence would be replaced with a crooked smile she detested her past and what happened in it they finally arrive at the location and Christina notes that below is a path that will lead to vermouths grave Eugene asks if they really have to jump off a cliff like this and she says that they must and she also knows that he can use flight magic but he must n't this time all he needs to do is grab her hand and trust her after Eugene does that Christina immediately jumps off and pulls a rod out\",\n",
       " \"of her tools she uses this rod to create a pair of wings but Eugene sees something else an angel with the hair and facial expression as an 's he snaps back to reality and tells Christina that he just saw an angel this makes her look at him weirdly as this is only a Divine spell that has nothing to do with angels it only protects the wearer from falling from a high place Eugene shuts up but he knows what he saw as that face was the same as an 's he 's positive Christina notes that they have arrived and when the yellow holy magic disappears Eugene is stunned as he is now in a beautiful Green Field Christina picks up a grass leaf and says that even though it looks like grass it 's not as it does n't have any Life Energy inside Eugene tells her that it 's only spatial magic and thinks that to create such a place would be impossible with only common magic so who did it seya or vermouth alas they continue forward and arrive at vermouths grave where a statue of him stands suddenly doers accompanied by Gillard appears and doers expresses his wish for every lionart to see this place but sadly it must be protected putting the haml statue around here is n't a bad idea as he was vermouths longtime friend so it would hold some meaning for it to stand by him however in order to open a path to this place one needs the Patriarchs and the Senate 's acknowledgement those two titles were created by the founder and it was said that besides the patriarch succession and appointment ceremony of the commander of the black lion Knights nobody else can enter Christina knows this is directed at her but as long as she respects their Traditions she came here with an important reason Gillard then explains that the timing was rather inappropriate as she stubbornly decided to follow his son into this place as the patriarch he could have just ignored this but did not to hold respect to both of their ancestors and she also said that she came here because of God 's revelation which coincidentally lines with the Demon King announcing his peace is almost over so he asks her to just say it already Christina says that she will dare to say it and pulls out the holy Rod once again she Christina reres the adopted son of Michael reres is the only saintus candidate in the whole holy Empire From This Moment forth she will will be representing the pope and right now she asks them to please open the grave of the Great Hero vermouth his soul did not go to heaven and from this Revelation his soul did not find Salvation and is still wandering the Earth as the saintus she must check the hero 's last moment doer says that he will follow whatever Gillard chooses who is kind of glad that he will be able to open the grave with his own hands once they get inside Christina numbers the number of beautiful things around here but they are all fake as there is nothing real inside of this Temple Gillard explains that it was the will of the founder to not have any descendants carve any statues or put decorations according to that they should n't put the haml statue here but considering that it was not made by one of his descendants it 's fine Christina thinks that this is beautiful to reunite two old friends in the same resting place this is certainly God 's will Eugene asks if defaming Hamill 's grave and insulting the corpse by letting it become a death knight is also God 's will Christina looks at him and says that it was n't that 's why he was able to get out of there and rescue the statue Eugene looks at her sternly as even a niece did n't use God 's name that much as this one does eventually they arrive at the coffin and Gillard tells them to observe while he opens it while the two close on the coffin Eugene thinks that he did n't know they would be doing it so swiftly he begs him to just be a body lying in the coffin a mummy hell even some bone would suffice he does n't care as long as he 's dead and lying in there if he really is dead he will find peace and with that he will be able to lift the suspicions he had on him Eugene thinks that vermouth was not involved with his reincarnation but fighting senia and forcing her to flee he also dams The Demon King as that bastard talked about love like he and vermouth were longtime friends he will never believe that so he begs the great vermouth to be dead when the coffin opens G is shocked but Christina already knew that the coffin is completely empty Eugene 's entire body wries and his fist is clenched so hard his veins are about to pop Gillard thinks that he 's only concealing himself but that does n't matter now as Christina announces she will tell them the Revelation From This Moment forward Eugene will be titled the next hero the man that succeeds the great vermouth this is the will of God and the pope also acknowledges it until now there have been no moves on the demon part so they will not announce it just yet but she will be with him as the holy Empire 's witness Gillard asks what she means and Christina notes that this is not God 's word but she thinks that Eugene is a Reincarnation of vermouth if that is true then she can accept why his soul did not enter Heaven as in order to face the danger that would fall on the world the hero 's Soul descended into a descendants body Eugene starts laughing and asks if she got permission to do this from her little God a [ __ ] hero what a joke he is The Reincarnation of vermouth how funny but she should really cut the [ __ ] just how great is their God that she is harassing him who is doing nothing and saying that he is The Reincarnation of the hero Christina apologizes as that was only her thoughts but she should n't blame her or God 's revelation for that matter Eugene disagrees he does n't even believe in her God and he does n't plan to so he will be doing whatever he wishes he is only himself Eugene lionhart so if she needs a hero she should make one from their worshipper or better yet beg her God to send one down he looks at Gillard who is flabbergasted and apologizes for the harsh words but he does not plan to be recognized as a damn hero so he should understand him while on the topic he does not want to be patriarch and will also not join the black lion knits just because he will not do these things it does n't mean that he will disrespect the family so so he asks him to continue to support him just like before Gillard with a heavy expression agrees and respects his decision Eugene smiles and tells Christina that he also has a message for her almighty God that is to go [ __ ] himself that is all he wanted to say Gillard is about to go into shock but Christina just stares at him and Eugene turns away as he is tired so he will be going to sleep Gillard asks what will happen to Hamill 's statue and Eugene explains that h would have not wanted to rest in a place where his comrade was n't with that the tale of Hamill 's reincarnation ends for now at least stay tuned in the future thank you for watching see you next time\"]"
